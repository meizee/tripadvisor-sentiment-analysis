71,Nusa_Dua_Beach,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian. The black sand beaches up in Tabanan and Tanah Lot  are only better because there's no-one on them :)",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 13, 2020"

Imagine my surprise then, when I recently went to the Museum Pasifika and realized how pleasant that experience was. The place undergoing now some renovations, going through the spacy exhibition rooms made me feel like an art student dicovering the graal. New paintings on the walls, new displays, a beautiful Raden Saleh popping out of a red wall, beautiful series of Le Mayeur and Theo Meier paintings. Just beautiful. And quiet.

I could say this is a hidden gem spot, usually known for nusa dua beach instead of Geger beach.If you have visited The Mulia Resort or St. Regis Bali, then you have been to Geger beach. My feedback, geger beach is clean beach due to its location with luxury hotels and it gets cleaned up everyday. You will find many chairs for sunbathing and watersports equipment rental such as scuba diving gear, Katamaran boat, snorkeling gears and surfboards.Fewer visitors are around on the southern coast of Geger Beach, and there is sundeck with umbrellas on the beach shoreline. Sundeck and umbrella, provided by the resort, for guests who stay in the resort. Hotel guests usually order drinks at the resort bar located on the beach area.

To your right will be the added charm of seeing the Pura Geger temple on the cliff top facing the sea. You can take a walk up to it via a more southern road that goes across a bridge which monkeys frequent. This is a lovely broad sandy beach  -  just watch out for the softness of it!

You can buy all the standard Bali tourist souvenirs available anywhere between Kuta to Ubud.....All be it, at slightly inflated and fixed prices.  This is not the place to buy ‘copy’/‘fake’ brand name items.  It is also NOT a factory outlet centre with the associated discounts. Everything sold here is the genuine article and current seasonal styles. The prices are the same as any retail store in Australia, e.g. Billabong board shorts @$80-$90AUD. There are definitely sales to be had.  However, once again the sale prices are the same discount/price as in Australia.

The beach is mostly owned by the grand resorts (e.g. Grand Hyatt) some of which will not let you use their facilities (unless you buy day passes) and others that will allow you to rent sun beds (for about 150,000 IDR). However, we found in the middle of these there is a small area where you can rent a bed in a nice stretch for 50,000 IDR. Look for the staff wearing green t-shirts as they will help you get setup on the sun bed. You can also get food and drinks delivered to your sun bed - it is very easy to do. When paddling with my baby daughter, I found the water clearer and a little gentler to the right of the public beds area - in front of one of the resorts (the Ayodanas is the name I think).If you walk north along the beach (or the path parallel to the beach), you will quickly get to an outcrop with the water blow hole and a nice garden area.

You can drive directly to this beach and car park, if you look for it on the road signs.  The first time I came down this way it seemed that after passing through the entrance barrier, where you are asked where you are going, you then follow the wide boulevards that all seem to terminate at entrances to all the main hotels. How to escape? Simply look for the name of this beach and follow!  The cafe bar is ok, good value drinks and food.  A little bit further on is a beach bar and restaurant which seemed nice with good views of beach and a pool I think you could use, but it was a loud too booming monotonous bass for me that day.

What is the highlight of this place is that it has 5 different religious places of worship all in one row showing harmony between them which is really beautiful. Aside from that there isn't much else that is exciting. You can't go into the Buddhist temple unless you are Buddhist and want to pray and be prepared to wear conservative clothes (shoulders covered etc) to have a look at some of them if they let you in at all.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written November 12, 2018"

The boys had fun on the slides that were open, and yes things are in need of repair but they still had fun and it seemed safe enough.

The food was ok too, its not a first class restaurant but we though the food was fine and at a good price.   On the bad side it did concern me greatly about the rusted condition of the structure of the frame for the stairs and the slide as a whole,  the hand rails were loose in areas and the stair treads had been covered over with aluminium plate in many areas.  I would be fearful of this place in 6 months but after a thorough check i was happy for the kids to use it in July 2018.....it is after all Bali and not Australia.   The surf ride was brilliant and my kids loved it, they even let my little one jump in the water jet to ride up the wave hill......as i mentioned the staff were great.

On arrival we had some confusion with what tickets everyone needed as there were different tickets for different things. But I think to just use the slides it was about $12AUD an adult and $7AUD a child and children were classified as 5-11 (I think). There are 3 types of slides a tube one, normal and the bowl type which hurt a bit due the joins in pipes not being flat and it hurt your back when sliding. There is a restaurant there which wasn't too bad I think we got a few baskets of hot chips and most of us had a few drinks which were slightly higher prices then as well but nothing compares to Australian prices. The location was perfect right on the beach overlooking a bay in Nusa Dua and apparently on one side there is a temple and the other side a blow hole. The place had a pool to use and also a kids pool with a cubby house into it. The wave rider is a hit with older children and adults as well. Overall a good place to come for a bit of chill out time for half the day. Just can't take any of your own food and drink in they will take it off you but return when you leave.

809,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"This place is not for kids under about 8. We took our 5 year old here, it was pretty much a waste of money.Firstly they have a sign saying you need to be 140cm or taller to use the waterslides (even though it says it's for kids 5+ ... never seen a 5 year old that tall before..). There are 3 waterslides, the wave riding slope, a small pool for general swimming, and a tiny toddler pool with a piece of toddler play equipment.Our 5 yr old was only able to use the red slide whilst sitting on our laps, the others were too rough and large for her.They have life jackets there to use for free which was good for her. They have one or two staff around the slides keeping an eye on them, though sometimes none at the bottom.Make sure you wear swimming undies and board shorts: the slides are pretty painful with only one layer, & we saw one guy lose his boardies on the wave rider.The slides are a bit rough, not smooth and gentle, and you need to lift your feet as you go down or they get burnt with scraping. The slides seem perfect for approx 8-17yr olds, for adults with more weight they can be a bit painful! There were some pretty brutal slide attempts we observed!The stairs are rusted, but have some grip on them thankfully.The (ladies) toilets were horrible & dirty, nowhere private to change, only one bench near the entrance to put your bag as you change. A male staff member was cleaning in the ladies when we entered :/There are lockers and towels you can hire which is good.Saw plenty of kids having a blast there, and no queues to use slides, but unfortunately our experience wasn't age-appropriate.

You can hire pool towels (large) for $1 ea, they have a pool you can use which was backyard size but enough to cool off in and the kids chose to ride the slides package which was the round space bowl & 2 smaller slides for $7.50ea, we thought this was great value as the adults didnt need to keep going up the top as it wasnt too high buut enough to get their 8-10yr old adrenaline pumping ;)  There is also a wave rider for about $15 for 2hrs, but i would not recommend this to kids under 8yrs unless they have experience in skiing or water ski or surfing as i saw a few MINOR injuries from falling off, including an older man with 2 bleeding head woounds (obviously not a skier lol)  he lol about it and the staff were great with assisting him with first aid.  We ordered the satays same as last time, Calamari rings, cheeseburgers for kids (which got sent back uncooked in the centre of meat), Cocktails, juices & water.  we arrived at 12 and were told the pizza dough was being made and would not be ready for 1hr so we didnt order pizza.  Our meals took over 1hr of going back and forth to waiters to ask where the chips, satays, Calamari and other ordeers were.  People around us were getting there orders and pizza long before our orders.  the upside was they tried to compensate with free drinks (cocktails) werent charge at the end and they had messed up the bills in terms of orders.  The satays chicken was so small i swear they chased a chick to make them in that hour and the sauce was average in taste.  The burgers had red uncooked meat so we had to wait until near dinner to get them back also (slight exaggeration, but seemed so long!)   The calamari was overcooked and my friend asked for fries not potato chips on the side as our other friend got wwith the burger.  Well they brang out the burger and potato crisps 25mins later!  we had to wait for the hot chips after that (so grumpy whingy kids at this point - lucky the cocktails were free i was almost chuggn them down :)  There is a fantastic view of the beach and lounges with cushions on the lawn area opposite the beach.  The restaurant has both upstairs & downstairs dining and only dozen chairs or lounges around the ppool and ony half with umbrellas!  Unfortunately our group 8 had to share 1 umbrella zone (i opted to turn my milk skin into cuppacino waiting for the food to arrive) and so the kids & friends i introduced to Surf & Turf could get some shade waiting for food.

We ended up  going there most days for an hour or two to break up the day/ have lunch / dinner  etc as my two sons 11 and 13 couldn't get enough of the simulated surf rider and water slides. Really good value at about $7/ hour for surfing or $15 for an all day slide package including 2hours of surfing. Many times we went there, the boys had the slides/surf rider to themselves or there was only a couple of other kids which was magic and a great way for them to burn off energy as Nusa Dua can be pretty quiet. The food was about a third of the price of our hotel and the menu was good, standard fare - burgers, sate chicken, pizza, noodles, etc. The pool deck had lots of sun lounges and overlooked the ocean.

830,Samabe_Bali_Pool_Beach_Club,"We visited the Samabe beach club with our kids along with another family we met in Bali. We noticed there have been a lot of new beach clubs built in Bali since our last visit and it seems to be the new trendy thing so we decided to visit Samabe's beach club, having loved our stay at Samabe as guests in the past. So, during our last full day in bali we decided to treat ourselves to a day at their beach club.It was around 350,000 rupiah per person (around $25), which is pretty affordable compared to some other beach clubs in the more crowded areas of Bali like Potato Head for example. A part of the fee is actually credit that we got to use to buy food and drinks. We could have also used it for the spa, but we were hungry! The fee also included the use of the beach or hotel pool, as well as kayaks, the gym and the kids club. I found it was great value for money, and since it only recently opened this beach club should be becoming more popular soon, keep your eye out!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 4, 2017"

836,The_Bay_Bali,This place looks nothing like the reviews and photographs as it was probably in its peak in the 2017 period and now appears in declineAlthough being far over rated we found the walk between the two headlands and in front of the fantastic hotels to be enjoyable and the beach appeared very clean and user friendly. Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk.

I observed several kids coming out of the water with plastic trash in their hair. I have been blessed to have the opportunity to visit many places around the world. I am partial to the ocean so always end up there. I would not even compare the Bali Bay beach to that of the Gulf of Mexico where I am from many years ago. If you are in the US, go to Padre Island or Myrtle beach it's cheaper and a better/cleaner beach and better value. If you're in Europe, pick almost any beach and it will be cleaner than this. I am very disappointed with Indonesia in general for letting this happen over the years. It's terrible, swimming with trash, even in front of the biggest hotels/resorts they don't seem to bother with trash pickup. If you find this a nice beach, you need to get out!

We arrived on our 3rd visit and there were another 2 adults wanting to go on, but they were closing in 30 mins ( not that this was advertised) but still wanted the full price for a 2 hour session!??!!?This place is asking to be closed down and I'm sure it's only a matter of time until it is.  Not only does it look derelict but it's very rundown and dangerous looking.....there are no staff around, no lights on around the bar and restaurant area, no music being played and all the chair and sunbed cushions are stacked away.  I wished I'd taken photos to show the shabbiest of it all.  It was probably a good omen my son was able to surf here as I'm sure the surf rider is unsafe and unmaintained.

The food was ok too, its not a first class restaurant but we though the food was fine and at a good price.   On the bad side it did concern me greatly about the rusted condition of the structure of the frame for the stairs and the slide as a whole,  the hand rails were loose in areas and the stair treads had been covered over with aluminium plate in many areas.  I would be fearful of this place in 6 months but after a thorough check i was happy for the kids to use it in July 2018.....it is after all Bali and not Australia.   The surf ride was brilliant and my kids loved it, they even let my little one jump in the water jet to ride up the wave hill......as i mentioned the staff were great.  The price was great too, my kids had more fun here than at the waterbom facility, and dad was able to relax easily here.

The one significant letdown were the slides that are in dire need of renovation. Actually they had closed the Space Bowl for safety reasons and there are only two slides left that didn't look like something was going to collapse right away so I let him have fun anyway, but later a lifeguard told us someone died when just that happened with the Space Bowl.

1211,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"I booked a bus from Kuta to head here for e arvo for something to do whilst we waited for more family and friends to arrive in Bali. On arrival we had some confusion with what tickets everyone needed as there were different tickets for different things. But I think to just use the slides it was about $12AUD an adult and $7AUD a child and children were classified as 5-11 (I think). There are 3 types of slides a tube one, normal and the bowl type which hurt a bit due the joins in pipes not being flat and it hurt your back when sliding. There is a restaurant there which wasn't too bad I think we got a few baskets of hot chips and most of us had a few drinks which were slightly higher prices then as well but nothing compares to Australian prices. The location was perfect right on the beach overlooking a bay in Nusa Dua and apparently on one side there is a temple and the other side a blow hole. The place had a pool to use and also a kids pool with a cubby house into it. The wave rider is a hit with older children and adults as well. Overall a good place to come for a bit of chill out time for half the day. Just can't take any of your own food and drink in they will take it off you but return when you leave. And pool towels were a cost can't remember now how much but no more then $5. So maybe take your own if you have some.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written April 6, 2017"

1227,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"This place is not for kids under about 8. We took our 5 year old here, it was pretty much a waste of money.Firstly they have a sign saying you need to be 140cm or taller to use the waterslides (even though it says it's for kids 5+ ... never seen a 5 year old that tall before..). There are 3 waterslides, the wave riding slope, a small pool for general swimming, and a tiny toddler pool with a piece of toddler play equipment.Our 5 yr old was only able to use the red slide whilst sitting on our laps, the others were too rough and large for her.They have life jackets there to use for free which was good for her. They have one or two staff around the slides keeping an eye on them, though sometimes none at the bottom.Make sure you wear swimming undies and board shorts: the slides are pretty painful with only one layer, & we saw one guy lose his boardies on the wave rider.The slides are a bit rough, not smooth and gentle, and you need to lift your feet as you go down or they get burnt with scraping. The slides seem perfect for approx 8-17yr olds, for adults with more weight they can be a bit painful! There were some pretty brutal slide attempts we observed!The stairs are rusted, but have some grip on them thankfully.The (ladies) toilets were horrible & dirty, nowhere private to change, only one bench near the entrance to put your bag as you change. A male staff member was cleaning in the ladies when we entered :/There are lockers and towels you can hire which is good.Saw plenty of kids having a blast there, and no queues to use slides, but unfortunately our experience wasn't age-appropriate.

1229,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"We came here last year after Pirate Bay next door and stayed for most of the day.  You can hire pool towels (large) for $1 ea, they have a pool you can use which was backyard size but enough to cool off in and the kids chose to ride the slides package which was the round space bowl & 2 smaller slides for $7.50ea, we thought this was great value as the adults didnt need to keep going up the top as it wasnt too high buut enough to get their 8-10yr old adrenaline pumping ;)  There is also a wave rider for about $15 for 2hrs, but i would not recommend this to kids under 8yrs unless they have experience in skiing or water ski or surfing as i saw a few MINOR injuries from falling off, including an older man with 2 bleeding head woounds (obviously not a skier lol)  he lol about it and the staff were great with assisting him with first aid.  We ordered the satays same as last time, Calamari rings, cheeseburgers for kids (which got sent back uncooked in the centre of meat), Cocktails, juices & water.  we arrived at 12 and were told the pizza dough was being made and would not be ready for 1hr so we didnt order pizza.  Our meals took over 1hr of going back and forth to waiters to ask where the chips, satays, Calamari and other ordeers were.  People around us were getting there orders and pizza long before our orders.  the upside was they tried to compensate with free drinks (cocktails) werent charge at the end and they had messed up the bills in terms of orders.  The satays chicken was so small i swear they chased a chick to make them in that hour and the sauce was average in taste.  The burgers had red uncooked meat so we had to wait until near dinner to get them back also (slight exaggeration, but seemed so long!)   The calamari was overcooked and my friend asked for fries not potato chips on the side as our other friend got wwith the burger.  Well they brang out the burger and potato crisps 25mins later!  we had to wait for the hot chips after that (so grumpy whingy kids at this point - lucky the cocktails were free i was almost chuggn them down :)  There is a fantastic view of the beach and lounges with cushions on the lawn area opposite the beach.  The restaurant has both upstairs & downstairs dining and only dozen chairs or lounges around the ppool and ony half with umbrellas!  Unfortunately our group 8 had to share 1 umbrella zone (i opted to turn my milk skin into cuppacino waiting for the food to arrive) and so the kids & friends i introduced to Surf & Turf could get some shade waiting for food.

We ended up  going there most days for an hour or two to break up the day/ have lunch / dinner  etc as my two sons 11 and 13 couldn't get enough of the simulated surf rider and water slides. Really good value at about $7/ hour for surfing or $15 for an all day slide package including 2hours of surfing. Many times we went there, the boys had the slides/surf rider to themselves or there was only a couple of other kids which was magic and a great way for them to burn off energy as Nusa Dua can be pretty quiet. The food was about a third of the price of our hotel and the menu was good, standard fare - burgers, sate chicken, pizza, noodles, etc. The pool deck had lots of sun lounges and overlooked the ocean.

Not expected from a 5 Star Resort which claims excellent Hospitality. I had to call the Butler Service  to get it waived. But it was surely a disappointment. On the day of the check-out, we were bombarded with phone calls right from 12 pm to vacate the room. We were on laid back holiday and were at the Beach so it took us just a while longer. We had also intimated the The Front Office previous night that we will check out around 1-1.30 pm. In spite of this, Front office also threatened my wife at least 3 times that they will charge for additional night if we do not check out immediately.

So, during our last full day in bali we decided to treat ourselves to a day at their beach club.It was around 350,000 rupiah per person (around $25), which is pretty affordable compared to some other beach clubs in the more crowded areas of Bali like Potato Head for example. A part of the fee is actually credit that we got to use to buy food and drinks. We could have also used it for the spa, but we were hungry! The fee also included the use of the beach or hotel pool, as well as kayaks, the gym and the kids club.

Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk.

I observed several kids coming out of the water with plastic trash in their hair. I have been blessed to have the opportunity to visit many places around the world. I am partial to the ocean so always end up there. I would not even compare the Bali Bay beach to that of the Gulf of Mexico where I am from many years ago. If you are in the US, go to Padre Island or Myrtle beach it's cheaper and a better/cleaner beach and better value. If you're in Europe, pick almost any beach and it will be cleaner than this. I am very disappointed with Indonesia in general for letting this happen over the years. It's terrible, swimming with trash, even in front of the biggest hotels/resorts they don't seem to bother with trash pickup. If you find this a nice beach, you need to get out!

It has left us with their intended promise, relaxed and completely rejuvenated. Perfect way to finish the holiday.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 4, 2020"

I have 3 hours couple body massage in a package, where it says 60 mins of body massage but they finished in 35 mins ! They also count the time you enter in the room and also the preparation for massage was also counted on my massage time !  However I kept a track when they started and finished ! We were also committed to have 10 min of foot massage but again no they haven’t give us any extra 10 mins massage! It seemed professional when we entered and they offered some drink and a form to sign and to mention where and how I want my massage to be done ,but it’s just a formality they don’t really check or consider as well client’s requirements!We were the last customers  so I found them they wanted to finish quickly and go home ! There was also no music in our 3 hours of massage which felt too boring and way too horrible quite ! I went another time to give again a try as the place was pretty clean I preferred give it another go and when I shared my last unsatisfying experience the reception girl didn’t admit and started arguing! anyway then I walked out of that place and went to the very good spa in Nusa Dua!

From there I picked my essential oil for the treatment and was led in to a beautiful room upstairs where my feet were washed. The 90 minute Balinesian massage wasn’t like a typical North American Massage. It was deep pressure as I asked but the style is a quicker repetitive hand movements rather than slow with elbows etc. Following the massage was a 90 minute “foot reflexology”. Lovely, but again not what a North American would think of when you have had reflexology. It was mostly a deep calf massage. The entire experience was lovely as long as you are open to the massage being a little different of a technique than you may be used to. I should mention that it was also very clean and friendly.

Foot reflexology was fine and executed on bed which saved time. Misses: The body scrub could be more scrubby, bubble bath equipment made some noise during massage but if you like the frivolity, this may not matter.

1733,TSL_The_Shampoo_Lounge_Nusa_Dua,"Wow- what an experience.  This place rocks.  The shop has been open for maybe a year.  Everything is new, very clean, hip and sharply decorated.  Feels like you have stepped into a fancy day spa in the states or any western country.All the staff are super friendly and for the most part speak excellent english.  Their range of services is vast and extensive for both men and women.  They have designed it to have a traditional men's barbershop on one side of the building and a fancier ladies salon on the other side of the building.Check out their website for a glimpse of their offerings.  If you don't see a service you are looking for, simply call or whattsapp them to ask if they can perform whatever you desire and chances are they will be able to arrange it.I go regularly for a mens' clip and cut.  If you connect with a specific barber, find out his work schedule and make a request for him when you book an appointment.  Speaking of appointments, I highly suggest calling ahead to do so, as on the weekends and even weekdays they can sometimes be empty and other days be slammed.The mens haricut rocks.  Starts out with a fantastic head massage/hariwash, followed by the cut of your choosing.  There is a huge board with suggested styles (all with a specific number to order by) you can check out while getting your wash.  Then afterwards order your haircut by number off of the board, or simply tell the barber if something specific and let them do the rest.  After your cut, back to the shampoo station you go to wash out all the short clipped hair and another scalp massage.  Finally back to the chair for any final touch ups, a fantastic neck/shoulder massage and style.  You would easily pay over $50+ UDS in a major city for a haircut experience like this.  At the Shampoo Lounge  it will be just a fraction of that price.  They are constantly offering special deals so call ahead and plan your visit accordingly.The Manager (Christina) is a gem.  She runs the place as if it is her personal mission to make every guest feel right at home.  Tell her Nathan sent you and she will take great care of you!And the best part of your Shampoo Lounge experience is the if you have worked up an appetite during your treatment, there is an amazing Mexican restaurant (Taqisa) just a short five minute walk to the south of the salon.  Best Baja Mexican food on the island.  Think Street tacos, Burritos with tender pulled meats and fresh salsa made daily.  A definite must if you are a foodie and enjoy south of the border authentic Mexican cuisine.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written April 11, 2020"

1839,Bali_Refresh_Spa,We went to Bali refresh based on the good reviews on TripAdvisor but we were sorely disappointed. There were 11 of us and they didn't have enough massuers so we waited. Then they ushered us to nearby small parlour which were dirty and gross. Some of us went to Kristina spa nearby which was much better.

1845,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"We stayed at a resort in Nusa Dua and obviously didn't want to pay the prices of the resort's spa for a good massage.  I had read the great reviews about Bali Refresh and we weren't disappointed.  Even better when we discovered how close it was to our resort!  My husband had a 2 hour Balinese body massage while I had 1.5 hours Balinese body massage then a 1/2 hour foot massage.  Both of our therapists were excellent, very professional and the massages were fantastic.  The spa is very clean with a nice ambience, good a/c and they provide a cold towel and welcome drink on arrival. We tried another spa in Tanjung Benoa for massage and one in Seminyak when we went for the day, and Bali Refresh was far superior in every way.  It cost just over $70 for both of us to have 2 hours each - absolutely brilliant for the high quality of the massage.  Highly recommended and will definitely go back next time we are in Nusa Dua!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written October 4, 2019"

1847,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"I discovered bali refresh spa in 2018 when i came to bali for the first time and stayed in Nusa Dua. I was so shocked by the prices and the quality or the massages that I had to bring my partner back who hates massages. He fell in love with the place. Im now here second time in Bali, 2019, staying in Nusa Dua,and have literally been going me and my partner every second day for hour massages. I've also had the sunburn treatment done which worked wonders as i was fried like a tomato, but the next day all the pain and redness was gone after that treatment I also had my pedicure done which came out so perfectly. The fact that they offer free transportation if you're in the nusa dua area makes it so easy to WhatsApp them 15 mins prior and say you would like to come down. So simple, so easy, the girls are great, the prices are amazing,and I highly recommend this place, it's hard not to go back!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 16, 2019"

Went as a walk in and was lucky enough to get right it.  The ladies were very good and the treatments were among the best we have had and we tend to get a massage wherever we are in the world on holiday.  Can not argue with the prices, so no renegotiating is needed.  Facilities were excellent, we had a shower afterwards no rush.

1851,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"My husband and I are visiting Bali for a quality relaxation trip. While we hesitated to pay the resort price for a massage, we also didn’t want to settle for a street side/beach but style massage either. For the equivalent $36 AUD (360,000IDR) we were able to get an hour each full body Balinese massage including cool tea and face cloth on arrival. The whole spa was clean and very well air conditioned, and the massage was fantastic! The one hour includes head, neck/shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs, feet and glutes, chest and even a cute tummy massage perfect for after an indulgent hotel buffet breakfast. Foot bath included, no sneaky add ons for fragrances oils unlike in other places. The whole room smelled of jasmine. I’ll be back tomorrow for a pedi, Hot stone and maybe a deep tissue too.
