35,Nusa_Dua_Beach,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian.

94,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,"I had parked at the Nusa Dua beach car park and walked up the walkway to the 2 sides of the Nusa Dua beaches.  Following the side that stretches south I walked what I thought was all Nusa Dua beach ( it is on some maps).  However I realised that there were a series of separately named beaches along this stretch with this being the last one! It was about 3.5km walk but worth it.  It is the very extensive beach frontage for a very impressive hotel. The swimming conditions here were better than at the Nusa Dua public beach area and worth the walk. I walked the way down along the sand and by the waters edge which makes for heavy going so it took me about an hour.  Coming back I cheated and used the extensive paved areas in front of each of the hotels.  It didn’t seem to matter so long as you are discrete and look as if you may be staying in the hotels LOL.  It really doesn’t take that long c 40mins. The highlight was a jetty that goes out to sea aways, a mini pier if you like, that looks up to the Temple that is not accessible from this beach.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 14, 2019"

However, we found in the middle of these there is a small area where you can rent a bed in a nice stretch for 50,000 IDR. Look for the staff wearing green t-shirts as they will help you get setup on the sun bed. You can also get food and drinks delivered to your sun bed - it is very easy to do. When paddling with my baby daughter, I found the water clearer and a little gentler to the right of the public beds area - in front of one of the resorts (the Ayodanas is the name I think).If you walk north along the beach (or the path parallel to the beach), you will quickly get to an outcrop with the water blow hole and a nice garden area.

You can drive directly to this beach and car park, if you look for it on the road signs.  The first time I came down this way it seemed that after passing through the entrance barrier, where you are asked where you are going, you then follow the wide boulevards that all seem to terminate at entrances to all the main hotels. How to escape? Simply look for the name of this beach and follow!  The cafe bar is ok, good value drinks and food.  A little bit further on is a beach bar and restaurant which seemed nice with good views of beach and a pool I think you could use, but it was a loud too booming monotonous bass for me that day.  The swimming from the beach is, as with all the beaches along this coast, crashing waves most days.

Not only does it look derelict but it's very rundown and dangerous looking.....there are no staff around, no lights on around the bar and restaurant area, no music being played and all the chair and sunbed cushions are stacked away.  I wished I'd taken photos to show the shabbiest of it all.  It was probably a good omen my son was able to surf here as I'm sure the surf rider is unsafe and unmaintained.

On arrival we had some confusion with what tickets everyone needed as there were different tickets for different things. But I think to just use the slides it was about $12AUD an adult and $7AUD a child and children were classified as 5-11 (I think). There are 3 types of slides a tube one, normal and the bowl type which hurt a bit due the joins in pipes not being flat and it hurt your back when sliding. There is a restaurant there which wasn't too bad I think we got a few baskets of hot chips and most of us had a few drinks which were slightly higher prices then as well but nothing compares to Australian prices. The location was perfect right on the beach overlooking a bay in Nusa Dua and apparently on one side there is a temple and the other side a blow hole. The place had a pool to use and also a kids pool with a cubby house into it. The wave rider is a hit with older children and adults as well. Overall a good place to come for a bit of chill out time for half the day. Just can't take any of your own food and drink in they will take it off you but return when you leave.

395,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"This place is not for kids under about 8. We took our 5 year old here, it was pretty much a waste of money.Firstly they have a sign saying you need to be 140cm or taller to use the waterslides (even though it says it's for kids 5+ ... never seen a 5 year old that tall before..). There are 3 waterslides, the wave riding slope, a small pool for general swimming, and a tiny toddler pool with a piece of toddler play equipment.Our 5 yr old was only able to use the red slide whilst sitting on our laps, the others were too rough and large for her.They have life jackets there to use for free which was good for her. They have one or two staff around the slides keeping an eye on them, though sometimes none at the bottom.Make sure you wear swimming undies and board shorts: the slides are pretty painful with only one layer, & we saw one guy lose his boardies on the wave rider.The slides are a bit rough, not smooth and gentle, and you need to lift your feet as you go down or they get burnt with scraping. The slides seem perfect for approx 8-17yr olds, for adults with more weight they can be a bit painful! There were some pretty brutal slide attempts we observed!The stairs are rusted, but have some grip on them thankfully.The (ladies) toilets were horrible & dirty, nowhere private to change, only one bench near the entrance to put your bag as you change. A male staff member was cleaning in the ladies when we entered :/There are lockers and towels you can hire which is good.Saw plenty of kids having a blast there, and no queues to use slides, but unfortunately our experience wasn't age-appropriate.

You can hire pool towels (large) for $1 ea, they have a pool you can use which was backyard size but enough to cool off in and the kids chose to ride the slides package which was the round space bowl & 2 smaller slides for $7.50ea, we thought this was great value as the adults didnt need to keep going up the top as it wasnt too high buut enough to get their 8-10yr old adrenaline pumping ;)  There is also a wave rider for about $15 for 2hrs, but i would not recommend this to kids under 8yrs unless they have experience in skiing or water ski or surfing as i saw a few MINOR injuries from falling off, including an older man with 2 bleeding head woounds (obviously not a skier lol)  he lol about it and the staff were great with assisting him with first aid.  We ordered the satays same as last time, Calamari rings, cheeseburgers for kids (which got sent back uncooked in the centre of meat), Cocktails, juices & water.  we arrived at 12 and were told the pizza dough was being made and would not be ready for 1hr so we didnt order pizza.  Our meals took over 1hr of going back and forth to waiters to ask where the chips, satays, Calamari and other ordeers were.  People around us were getting there orders and pizza long before our orders.  the upside was they tried to compensate with free drinks (cocktails) werent charge at the end and they had messed up the bills in terms of orders.  The satays chicken was so small i swear they chased a chick to make them in that hour and the sauce was average in taste.  The burgers had red uncooked meat so we had to wait until near dinner to get them back also (slight exaggeration, but seemed so long!)   The calamari was overcooked and my friend asked for fries not potato chips on the side as our other friend got wwith the burger.  Well they brang out the burger and potato crisps 25mins later!  we had to wait for the hot chips after that (so grumpy whingy kids at this point - lucky the cocktails were free i was almost chuggn them down :)  There is a fantastic view of the beach and lounges with cushions on the lawn area opposite the beach.  The restaurant has both upstairs & downstairs dining and only dozen chairs or lounges around the ppool and ony half with umbrellas!  Unfortunately our group 8 had to share 1 umbrella zone (i opted to turn my milk skin into cuppacino waiting for the food to arrive) and so the kids & friends i introduced to Surf & Turf could get some shade waiting for food.

We ended up  going there most days for an hour or two to break up the day/ have lunch / dinner  etc as my two sons 11 and 13 couldn't get enough of the simulated surf rider and water slides. Really good value at about $7/ hour for surfing or $15 for an all day slide package including 2hours of surfing. Many times we went there, the boys had the slides/surf rider to themselves or there was only a couple of other kids which was magic and a great way for them to burn off energy as Nusa Dua can be pretty quiet. The food was about a third of the price of our hotel and the menu was good, standard fare - burgers, sate chicken, pizza, noodles, etc. The pool deck had lots of sun lounges and overlooked the ocean.

400,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"We stumbled on Surf & Turf by accident while looking for somewhere to eat in Bali collection.  It's a small beach club (not a hotel) with 3 water slides and a flowRider.  Our 12 year old son LOVED it.  It's small but suited us just fine.  Staff are friendly and welcoming, especially Gede who welcomed us from the beach front.  Nusa Dua is a very quiet area so our son was getting very bored until we found this place.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 30, 2016"
401,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"We loved this place as an alternative to our resort for the afternoon. It cost 70 000rph to enter and you can stay as long as you like(kids under 5 are free). There are only 3 slides, a pool and baby pool but that was enough to entertain my 6 and 4 year olds. Plenty of deck space with pool lounges for the grown ups to kick back on, cheap cocktails and beer, and the food was cheap compared to resort food. The staff were super friendly and helpful. It's right next door to Pirate Bay which the kids love too, and the calm, clean beach is in front of the establishment. It kept everyone entertained for the arvo! We'll definitely go back for an afternoon on our next visit to Bali.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 27, 2016"
402,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,We were looking for a more family friendly beach club in Nusa Dua where the beach waters were less rough than the Seminyak/Kuta area where we were staying.    Surf & Turf came up as a choice.   The beach was much calmer and more clean than Seminyak/Kuta.  The only downside was that the beach was much more rocky.Surf & Turf itself though was quite disappointing.   The pictures made it look much more majestic in terms water slides and kids activities.  The facilities were quiet dilapidated and run down.  The grounds were poorly maintained.   The food quality was questionable and the English of the staff was below average.  It was one of our worst experiences in Bali.  We planned to stay there for the whole day and could only handle 2 hours.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 24, 2016"
403,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"Cost RP200,000 per child for all the rides (limited to 2 hrs on the wave rider but unlimited time on the others). Parents are free entry, unless you want to ride as well. Our boys (11 & 9) love mastering the wave rider which was fun and safe. Some tips: no external food or drink allowed in and bring lots of sun protection.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 24, 2016"
404,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"Went yesterday for a half day. The kids had a blast. It is not 5 star but all they want are slides, wave rider, no lines and non stop fun.Staff were so helpful and always had a smile on their faces.Had a great lunch too.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 23, 2016"
405,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,This place is quite small with not many rides. You can get a beer and food there. The best thing about it is the surf ride . Adults and little kids can both ride it.

408,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"Today is the second time I and my husband spent an afternoon in here. Food is lovely, reasonably priced (we ordered pizza (65k), two soups (45k for one), fish and chips (65k)). Food cooked perfectly, not oily at all. Portions are average sizes. Do not pay any attention to comments about injuries -as almost everywhere, you enter swim facilities at your own risk, and if you have kids - you must watch them at all times ( this is just a common sense). Entry is free, if you need, you can hire a towel (10k), or a locker (10k). Overall, it's a good ""4"" star place.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written November 9, 2016"

412,Samabe_Bali_Pool_Beach_Club,"We loved our weekend there. Quite, beautiful, clean. The villa was very homy and airy, very well equipped. They managed to take into account every little little detail. Just loved it. There were some service issues, but it was that disturbing if you know what i mean. The manager of the resort is really there all the time, which gives you a sense of presence. U feel they take care about you. We haven't managed to try the food in the cave resto as it was fully booked. But the breakfast was quite nice with average coffee though, which is not good enough for coffee lover, but normal for the big hotel like this. Views are rare, great chilly breeze....loved it and will come back for sure.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 11, 2018"

414,Samabe_Bali_Pool_Beach_Club,"Though the Hotel offers great views of the Indian Ocean with great landscaping, but its a BIG disappointment in Guest services. We booked Ocean View Private Pool Suite. Food is very average and you can explore many other options available in the area. We asked Room Service to warm up our 3 items of pre-packed food. After 10 mins, she calls and tells us that there will be a charge of $6 for warming the food. Though we felt strange but agreed. However, when the food comes we found they charged $6 for each item! Not expected from a 5 Star Resort which claims excellent Hospitality. I had to call the Butler Service  to get it waived. But it was surely a disappointment. On the day of the check-out, we were bombarded with phone calls right from 12 pm to vacate the room. We were on laid back holiday and were at the Beach so it took us just a while longer. We had also intimated the The Front Office previous night that we will check out around 1-1.30 pm. In spite of this, Front office also threatened my wife at least 3 times that they will charge for additional night if we do not check out immediately. They even sent a buggie to our villa without even telling us to take our luggage. Big Harassment! We literally squeeze in everything into our bags and rush. This Hotel certainly needs to learn from its Neighbour Mulia what exemplary Hospitality is!",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 19, 2017"
415,Samabe_Bali_Pool_Beach_Club,"We have discovered PARADISE here at Samabe.  We are a family of 4 and have come to Samabe on a Scoopon Deal.  If you are considering Samabe for your next luxury holiday BOOK IT NOW!!!We were greeted at the airport with a warm smile and transported in a luxury van to Samabe late at night.  When we arrived we were promptly welcomed by the lovely staff, layed and offered a nice cold coconut drink and peppermint refreshment towel.  Check in was smooth, fast and informative then we were whisked away in a buggy to our lovely room.We were so pleasantly surprised to wake to the stunning ocean view from our room. The room itself is equipped with everything we could need and more and is very spacious, clean and comfortable. There is a lounge and dining room, two bathrooms and a huge bedroom with two queen beds and a single bed.The beds are very comfortable, the bath tub is huge and the shower is devine. There are two TV's in separate rooms which is great when you have kids. There are lots of channels and YES they do have Setanta which plays all of the rugby league games live! The rooms are equipped with all amenities and there is even a pillow menu.The resort itself is gorgeous. It is immaculately clean and has all of the necessary facilities. The infinity pool overlooks the ocean and has a bar. The gym is 24 hours which is handy. There are 2 restaurants. The breakfast is spot on offering a buffet and a la carte menu with plenty of variety for everyone whether you want to pig out, eat healthy or require gluten free. The other restaurant offers a great selection of western, asian and seafood. Everything we've ordered has been exceptional.There is a kids club from 9:00am to 5:00pm everyday which offers various activities for the children to enjoy. This gives you the opportunity to take advantage of the heavenly spa. The massages we got combined with the ambience and caring service at the spa have been a highlight for me.The resort has a private beach down 170 safe steps from the pool. The staff work tirelessly to keep the beach pristine and there are several sunbeds and beanbags on offer with lots of cool shady spots to relax in. They offer kayaks, paddle boards, windsurfers, snorkelling gear and a catamaran. There is also a small bar for refreshments.  But the highlight is the two caves which are used for special romantic meals and afternoon tea – which was such a special experience for our family.The service at Samabe is second to none. From the moment we arrived we have been greeted, pampered and looked after by every single staff member.  They all go out of their way to ensure that every one of our needs are met. I would like to thank each and every one of the staff for making our entire stay so special and memorable. The resort is stunning but you are the ones that make Samabe our new favourite slice of heaven on earth.We always like to explore and try new things so we have never stayed at the same place twice but Samabe you have captured our hearts with your warmth and serenity so we will be back. Thank you!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written April 7, 2017"
