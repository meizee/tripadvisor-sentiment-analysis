62,Seminyak_Beach,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written July 9, 2020"

82,Seminyak_Beach,"I have just spent 5 days in Seminyak. The food here is amazing and the choice of restaurants is fantastic. There is also great choices for accommodation. We chose a Villa with our own pool. Beautiful with good staff but just a little to far out of the main area for easy access back into the restaurants. Be sure to do research for accommodation location. Unfortunately that's where it stops. After a while I got tired of people trying to rip me off. If I choose to barter for an item and I pay too much then that's my bad luck but when I change money I expect to get what is advertised out the front of the shop. I always count my money 2 or 3 times before I leave. In one day out of 4 money changers 3 tried to rip me off. That's just down right stealing. When you catch them out they are more than happy to give back your Aussie money and you move on. It frustrates me when cars have taxi signs on them and when you get in there is no meter. If that's the case I am more than happy to offer the same rate I pay when I catch a cab but they try to charge 2 to 3 times. I go on holidays for food, culture and local attractions, not spend my whole time trying not to be ripped off.In contrast I spent 6 days at the The Lovina Villas in Lovina. This is paradise. The people are beautiful, the resort is amazing and there is plenty of local attractions in the area.

Unlike Legian and Kuta, there were no people on the beach selling beers or sodas, only a few other tourists to share the beach with. My only complaint is that the water is polluted. The water is a little worse in Legian and Kuta, even though people were surfing in the water. The water is definitely polluted as you pass a dead fish on the beach about every 100 feet. I wanted to surf, but when I saw a dead lion fish on the beach, I worried about being poisoned if I hit a dead one while swimming.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 27, 2020"

I fit a 5XL but it seems that there are different sizes in 5XL - American, European, Asian; it just beggars credibility that a 5XL may not be a 5XL. The antique shop had some interesting items but we demurred. We took the escalator to the First Floor and encountered the screening around the future H & M outlet.

If they don't agree with that simply have cash in hand and show it to them.  Attempt to force the cash in there direction. If they don't accept then walk out.   They will lower their dollar closer to your intended purchase price as you leave.  Keep to your guns and still wave the cash about.  Return back to the stall 5 to 10 mins and greet them. Show cash in hand again and ask if they want to make sale.  9/10 they will accept offer or they will better there asking price for 10000 more on top.

I stepped into 'Positive Negative Visual Gallery' as it was in Seminyak itself where I was staying and I loved the fact that this quaint gallery attracted so many visitors. There were plenty of paintings on display and the  host was mingling with all with elan. I was glad I visited this place.

We took a cab from the W Hotel and the driver dropped us off at a large modern mall. Whatever I was looking for could not be found in a mall, so we set out on foot with no particular destination in mind. Pausing to get our bearings in a little alleyway/street, my eyes were drawn to the display windows of Folkart Gallery...and as we entered I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued to hear Johnny Cash wafting out of the sound system. The Man in Black, in Seminyak? It was so incongruous...that is, until we made the acquaintance of the owner, Linda, an American expat who originally hails from Missoula, Montana. Her shop is filled with tantalizing treasures from all over...jewelry, objets d'art, antiques, and exquisite fabrics ranging from local and regional woven pieces to museum-quality specimens. I was limited to something that would pack flat in my suitcase, so I zeroed in on the fabrics, but I mentioned another interest -- Balinese shadow puppets -- and Linda had her assistant locate four fabulous antiques, two of which I decided to ""adopt"" on the spot. I'm now back in Dallas and am reminded every time I look at my prize puppets of a spectacular day in Bali and a wonderful encounter with a Johnny-Cash-loving Montana native who owns a store you simply must visit if you find yourself in Seminyak.

However, I had previously injured my foot, & couldn't walk, so the boys went down to the shop & asked whether it would be possible for them to come to our villa. Maarif agreed & half an hour later they were at the villa, tape measure in hand.  Maarif couldn't have been more helpful.  He even took my foot jewellery with him, to adjust, as it was a little tight on my feet. & also fixed up our hair ornaments & a refashioned a belt with some satin.Over the course of the next 2 weeks, we had several fittings & were very happy with the final result.  Aside from the dresses, the guys ordered some tailor made suits for our special event, & others to take home, plus jeans, a belt, shoes & some beautiful leather goods.  The quality of everything was top notch & we were more than happy with the price too.Maarif really is a gem, such a helpful, genuine guy.  He dropped us off at Poppy's Lane one night after one of our fittings at Tanah Lot.  This is quite the distance, but he did it all with a smile.He even organised for his partner to do our hair on the morning of our special occasion.  She did a great job! & they were of course invited to be part of our event.He appears to be one of those ""can do"" guys.  The answer is pretty much always yes ... and if it's not something he does himself, he knows someone who does, & can organise it for you.
