0,Sindhu_Market,"We love to eat at food courts and night markets and this one did not disappoint. Approximately 15 different stalls serving a variety of foods. Started with chicken satay sticks which were very tasty. A little on the small side, but at only $1.50 for 10 sticks how can you go wrong. Usual Nasi Goreng and Mie Goreng for under $3 but our new favourite meal is Tami Goreng which is mixed veges and chicken over fried noodles. We went three out of the 6 nights we were in Sanur and because my husband had left something behind at the hotel we also came back to the area after a day trip to Ubud and went to the market again. Also recommend the banana fritters, especially if they are freshly cooked.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written March 18, 2020"

3,Sindhu_Market,"Went to this market based on trip advisor reviews, it was exactly as we expected. Small with roughly about 15 eateries. We chose to try a few different smaller bites. Satay chicken was yummy but a 40 minute wait to order and we  were the 1st in line, all the locals get fed 1st they don’t wait in line and they just keep turning up. There was also very little chicken on each skewer, 10 skewers per serve for $1.50.We also went to the fried food stall with spring rolls fried banana, fried beans donuts etc got 17pieces for $1.70 an absolute bargain and also all delicious, especially the fried coconut donut...omg. I also got the fresh juice of banana and dragon, also absolutely delicious . All up dinner cost for both of us $8.80 which included all the above plus a Bintang.My husband and I both left feeling so full. Simple no fuss and delicious.

We had the Nasi Campur from a stall in the middle of the market. Very spicy - which we were warned about and it had a vegetable on the plate we couldn’t identify but was delicious.  Very reasonably priced 2 plates and 2 drinks were 800000 IDR.  We also tried some desert from a different stand.I liked the fact that the food here was made for Balinese (price wise) and the flavours weren’t watered down to western tastes - unlike most restaurants in the tourist areas.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 21, 2019"

We were all able to eat for around 120,000-150,00 rupiah, including 2 beers, which is amazing value!We had the most delicious Nasi Goreng we’ve ever had, a tasty meatball soup, Martabak Mie Goreng and Cap Cay with boiled rice. We also had A variety of donuts, deep fried banana, deep-fried coconut and smoothies. All of the food was cooked freshly in front of us, and all of the areas including tables and chairs were very clean. We visited at a variety of different times, and each time found that it wasn’t too busy, but there was enough of an atmosphere for us all to enjoy it. You may need to be prepared to wait for spaces at a table, if you arrive at a busy time, but the sellers are usually quite happy for you to perch at a space where you can. There’s a toilet in the corner of the Square, so if you need to use facilities while you’re there (which our children did) there is somewhere to use. You will need to ensure you have your own hand-gel and toilet roll though!It was a great atmosphere, with a number of locals eating there, as well as people from all over the world.

The water at Tirta Empul temple comes from a freshwater spring said to be located where the god Indra threw his spear into the ground, making it a holy place. Water from the spring is sold in containers like water from other holy places such as the well of Zamzam or Lourdes Water, and drinking or bathing in the water is believed to bestow cleansing or restorative benefits like bathing in Rajastan's Pushkar Lake, the Biblical pool of Bethesda, or the Ganges River. The benefits are believed to be especially strong at auspicious hours. At Tirta Empul temple the most auspicious hour for bathing is said to be just before midnight. Healing is supposed to take place after  praying, making offerings, and performing rituals at the proper spigot of water.  Different spigots are identified as healing different ailments.  Foreigners pay Rp. 50,000 per head to enter, and Indonesians pay Rp. 30,000. For this fee you get the free use of a sarong which you have to return when you leave.

The name of the temple comes from the ground water source named ""Tirta Empul"".The temple is dedicated to Vishnu, another Hindu god name for the supreme consciousness Narayana.At the entrance they provide the sarong for free if you want to have a view around, and if you want to do the rituals a green color sarong is provided for 10000 IDR.I would have loved to do the ritual, but due to the time to catch my flight i was not able. for sure during my next visit i will make sure to take part of the ritual if permitted.The temple complex has a  huge Koi Fish pond on the other side of the ritual part and another complex of temples and huge lake pond from which is the source of fresh water for the ritual process.Definitely need to visit when in Bali",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 29, 2018"

333,Sanur_Morning_Market,"One of my enjoyable things to do in Bali is to catch a bemo down the street to the early morning market (5.30/6am is a good time to go).   Hail a bemo along the main street (Jalan Danau Tamblingan) and tell them you want to go to the Pasar Pagi (morning market).  Ask your hotel if you are not sure where it is so you are heading in the right direction.  Costs 5,000 rupiah for a bemo ride anywhere along the Sanur strip,  have correct change to give the driver when you get dropped off.  Walk through the motorbike car park area and you will discover a hive of activity with locals doing their daily shopping for vegetables, meat, fish, flowers, offerings.    You'll find the bali coffee/kopi stall on the northern end of the rows of stalls where you can get an 'eyes wide open' genuine bali kopi to drink while you wake up and watch the goings on.    At the northern end just outside the large hall you will find the ladies making and selling the bantens (little daily offerings full of flowers) and also some snack vendors selling yummy snacks.   Just hand over 5,000 and you'll get a little bag of freshly cooked pisang goreng (small fried bananas) or vegetable or tofu fritters.   Also some shops selling clothes, sarongs etc.   Other shops there sell kitchenware, spices, traditional fabrics/sarongs/traditional temple offering items.

There was nobody around to answer questions and possibly the most interesting thing to me was the opportunity to see the inside of a traditional Balinese house. I think there is so much more which could have been done with what was a fascinating subject. One thing which I thought was off was that there was no consideration of the fact a 57 year old man married a 15 year old girl after knowing her for three years.

417,Le_Mayeur_Museum,"We have been coming to this part of Sanur for 10 years and have never visited the museum before, in part because it only opens during the low season and is difficult to find.  Certainly for the last four years I have been well aware of Le Mayeur and whilst not keen on the genre have wanted to visit the museum.Like most museums in Indonesia, this is somewhat disappointing, with few original paintings (in fact I didn't spot any).  Of course Indonesians blame the Dutch for pillaging their country, but in the case of Le Mayeur I suspect the culprits to be much closer to home.  Despite not liking the genre, nor the paintings being original, like so many I was attracted to Ni Pollok's firm breasts.  Being Belgium I cannot accuse Le Mayeur of being a part of the Dutch myth of Bali as paradise, nor the more recent of a paradise lost, but his paintings certainly support the myth.  So much so that I bought a number of reproduction postcards of Balinese girls breasts, which like Le Mayeur's paintings were sold to docking cruise ships.So overall I rated the museum at 3*, maybe even 2 was more realistic, but the villa and gardens are 5*.  The villa takes one back to another age, maybe even a paradise lost.  It's full of Balinese antiques and very traditional.  Every door is small with a step, like on a cruise ship, is this to prevent flooding, or snakes?  The gardens are wonderful and peaceful.I for one will certainly return and if you are anywhere near please visit.

You'll actually also learn a bit here the ""timeline"" of the places he lived & travelled to (before coming to settle down in Bali in his 50's) through his paintings of scenes in various places such as Europe & North Africa as well as scenes in some places not too far away from Bali such as that of Angkor Wat that he did in the 1920's (which I was actually somewhat surprised to see looking not much different compared to when I visited in 2014).  And on the grounds, in the small shelter right beside the house are a bust of him & that of his wife (which in my opinion is the ""best way"" of honoring them on their property).I would suggest like a half day for the Sanur Beach where this museum is located near the north end of the beach (with also the Sanur Market selling souvenirs & food although it's on a ""much-smaller"" scale compared to the great shopping area near the Kuta Beach across town); then after this museum (& the market), the best would be to head south along the ""paved walkway"" alongside the beach for really just about ""as far as"" you can walk (might be about 5 km in total of which I walked about ""half"" to the second market along the way where I believe the beach becomes known as the Sindhu Beach instead of Sanur), and yes you'll see some good ""swimming spots"" as well along the way.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 29, 2018"

There he met the young Legon-dancer Ni Pollok who became his model, muse and later his wife. His paintings sold well and enabled him to build a large mansion and some other structures alongside the beach of Sanur. All his work, primarily featuring Balinese scenes, but also a number from the many other countries that Le Mayeur had visited as he had travelled widely before arriving in Bali is displayed in these living quarters ornamented with classical Balinese elements such as carved wood furnishings, sculpted stone walls and terrazzo floor tiles. After his and her death all this was bequeathed to the Indonesian government and turned into a museum. It is a pleasure to walk through the various rooms as they give such a lovely picture of the culture of Bali of a largely foregone era.

This was followed by a sea walker adventure, which again with a language barrier made me nervous but once down below the water was amazing.  The guides were fantastic.  The sealife came so close and given bread from the guides, encouraged the fish to come right up so you can almost touch them.  The snorkelling was equally amazing feeling like I was among ""Nemo"" and friends!

Our shuttle back to the boat from our Lembongan location was supposed to be free. We were picked up by one of their drivers at an agreed upon location.  The driver showed up at the designated time, stated our hotel name and said he was our driver.  The guy took us to the wrong location and demanded 150,000 IDR or he would not let us out of their tuk tuk.  We were able to get ahold of the company and they played it off as a “miscommunication”  and told us we got into the wrong cab and it was our fault.  Driver said if we didn’t pay him he was going to leave us stranded in the middle of no where.  We agreed to pay and he took us to the correct location.  When we got to the boat, I gave him the money and he then opened the tailgate to let us out.  In the end the company gave us back the 150,000.

There are few resorts along this strip – most notably the fairly new MAYA SANUR** plus the WERDHAPURA BEACH**, HYATT REGENCY** and long-established PENEEDA VIEW**, but work on several large projects behind fenced areas was apparent in 2018. More common are walled VILLAS behind the SANUR BEACH PATH**. If staying inland, the only two lanes down to KARANG are JALAN PANTAI  KARANG and further south JL. DANAU BUYAN.LESS THAN WHELMING is the beach itself – with the exception of the first 300m from the north (sometimes referred to as WERDAHAPURA BCH.) which gets some protection from groynes mentioned above, it tends to be narrow (sand varies with severity of wet season storm erosion) and tide affected (disappearing in places highest tides of month) and maybe not as clean as better GREATER SANUR sections. An indication of this: the rather nice mid-range PARAGATA RESORT** up JL. DANAU BUYAN has its BEACH CLUB 10 minutes stroll north on WERDAHAPURA.The lagoon off the beach is as nice as most other sections for a swim or snorkel (won’t appeal to hard core snorkelers) and doesn’t seem to get too shallow low tide.Of course the beach at lower tide levels is just the place if you like sunning in seclusion (although lotsa people pass on the beach path).TIPS – staying somewhere along KARANG or inland? A short walk north or south on the beach path will find some nice sand.- basic shopping-wise the best area is where JL PANTI KARANG hits the beach path.

As such the ample sand is groomed daily, lined with sunlounge-umbrellas and the backing beach-path has no lack of restaurant/cafes (some with live music) plus lotsa traditional beach stalls selling the usual touristy clothing and trinkets. The lagoon our front has the usual attractions (outrigger rides, snorkeling, sailboarding and other water sports) and doesn’t appear to get too shallow low tide.The southern half (sometimes called PANTAI MERTASARI) is less attractive. Sand narrows, not groomed as well (no backing resorts), and BENOA INLET’s reef gap allows waves to flood some beach and path sections during highest fortnightly tides. Nevertheless I always make the effort to stroll down here because the area is a bit of a SCENE – not just the pandemonium those tides cause beach traders etc, but because about mid way is a small section of slightly higher beach on which warung/cafes offer budget food and drink (very few on-sand budget warungs left in Sth Bali). I buy a beer and watch boats of various size glide into/out of BENOA HARBOUR. A bit further, near beach end is a section with excellent access from inland (not so great north of here) – consequently early morning/late afternoon many local families enjoy sand and water. Bali beach culture is good value.**TRIPADVISOR has separate review pagesTIPS – looking for less expensive accommodation?

So if you still do that... That's your own problem. 2) yes the music was loud as 7 hells, but in my trip it was mostly bc all of the ppl on the top floor of the boat, we're young ""kids"" going to party island and they were playing it... 3) Yes, the crew was smoking all the way to the harbour, but same as half of the passengers on the top floor... 4) yes, they were asking ppl if they want a beer, but if you aren't sure it's not for free (just think about this - nothing is for free in this world 🤦🏽) ask the crew and don't write stupid reviews about them giving out ""what looks like free beer but it wasn't"" bc if you don't ask it's your problem. 5) ppl also complain about delays... Can't deny that, but my trip was even slightly faster than it should be. All depends on the weather. 6) They took us in the small boat which took us to the Golden Queen...

There is no forward planning with this service which means you can sit at docks for over 20 minutes. When docked, the boat is switched off which means air con is gone. The boat quickly becomes very hot and stuffy and the fumes from petrol get overwhelming and made me feel nauseous every time. One of the male boat crew took my bag at Gili Air for the trip back to Sanur. I noticed about an hour into the trip that he was at the back of the boat with my bag and was sleeping on it! He slept on it for at least an hour and a half after I noticed. I took my bag to sit with me after the boat docked at one of the stops. This man then came back to my row of seating and sat in the chair one seat down from me (3 seats per row) and blocked me and my bag in the row. There were plenty of other seats as the boat was mostly empty. After the next dock, I was the only person left in the cabin, yet he still loitered around me.

His 'friend' was waiting there to rip us off and share the benefits with our driver. First lie he told us was that ferry service didn´t exist at all, which as we checked personally after was completely false as there are ferries everyday. Second lie, at first he tried to charge for a one way trip in fast boat to Nusa Penida 400.000 rupies which is like 25 euros for a 15 minute trip. I managed to get it for 300.000 (19 euro) and he took me to the Golden Queen office where they actually sell the tickets. After we asked in other places where they sold the same tickets from 175.000 rupies. Third lie, the fast boat arrived one hour later than he said. He also offered us some activities like snorkelling while we waited (we had about 4 hours to wait) supposedly organized by 'Bloo Lagoon' (with spelling mistake included) also to share the benefits with the driver who took us there.

612,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,We had our hotel book the trip to Gili Islands. We had a friendly driver that picked us up at the hotel. Getting the tickets in Padangbai was a bit chaotic. The boat was also a bit delayed because of the rain. I would say the outgoing trip was OK.On the return trip the issues started. There were waves and the fast boats could not go. There was quite bad service on Gili Air to arrange our transfer with a smaller boat to Lombok. We had to drive in a bus to another place in Lombok to take the ferry. There was little information from the crew on the bus trip and on the ferry. Another company (Bluewater express?) gave their passengers lunch and kept informing them all the way on the ferry.  Seems a lot more professional.When we arrived Bali after a long journey we were told that the shared shuttle to Sanur would take a long time as it would be the last stop on the journey. We were offered to take a private car to our hotel instead at the cost of 500.000 IDR. We negotiated this down to 350.000 and took the private car.I am not sure if  i would use them again. I think it would depends on pricing. Bluewater express seemed alot more professional.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written August 5, 2018"

We asked several people from the company and they ALL said the same thing. Well we stopped twice before arriving to Gili Air and the boat trip took a bit more than 2 hours.2) Crew wasn’t friendly at all. They’re just on the deck putting on super loud music, dancing between themselves. And when I say the music was super loud it was SUPER loud.3) They advertise aircon in the cabin...it was really hot in there and difficult to breathe.4) They advertise free mineral water but all they did was trying to sell beer to all passengers over and over again.The trip back from Gili Air was the worst. When leaving the harbour the boat hit the deck really hard and later we saw there was almost a whole where it hit. After that we were quite uncomfortable with the staff...did they even know what they were doing because they sure did not look like they did. There was a lot of wind and the sea was rough. It was really scary.The trip lasted 3 hours! Because the sea was so bad we drifted up north and made our way back south when getting closer to the coast.And when we arrived in the harbour. Everybody was quite shaken up.The staff was never reassuring.They did not even talk to the passengers.They put the music back on SUPER loud as we were now in more quiet waters.And we waited 1 more hour there near the harbour because we had to wait for several boats to disembark first.It wasn’t a good experience and I sure would have liked to know how unprofessional the company and the staff were before getting on a boat with them!",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written June 12, 2018"

It is pretty much like the thousands of other small, open air Hindu places of worship on Bali and associated islands.  Patal is on the boardwalk running along the back of Sanur Beach.  It is typical in its design - dark structures, statues depicting ancient Hindu motifs, incense, flowers.  As it is open-air and easy to access the temple appears to be an empty plot.  The only sign it is an active location is the small offerings lain at the portal.  As there are so many similar structures, this one does not particularly stand-out.  Indeed it easy to walk on by without noticing much about the temple.  Perhaps the best part of Patal temple is its beach location but modern life has surrounded it with low quality restaurants and hundreds of deckchairs so the environment it may once have enjoyed is no longer here.

On Gili T, getting on the boat was fine and getting our ticket was fine. When we sat down we realised just how small and cramped this boat was, with people’s suitcases lining the sides of the gangway down the boat. There were air-con vents but no air-con. The windows had to be closed because the waves were kicking up water that was being blown in. We were sat about half way down the boat and we could not feel any air flow at all. There was some space at the back of the boat to stand with the staff but not much space for many people. Thankfully we had a small electric fan with us, if we didn’t have it we would have suffered.

663,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"I usually did not write reviews but i can not hold myself in writing the review for Semaya one. I Traveled with Semaya one 3 times as recently as 2nd Jan and 4th Jan 2020. Before booking with them i have read all the reviews and i was prepared for all the consequences. I booked the fast boat to travel between Nusa Penida to Gili Air and Back to Bali. The online price was showing was very high. So as suggested by many fellow traveler, i decided to book the boat by going to Harbor. The price i got was 350.000 IDR (Because first they will transport me to Padang Bai and then to Gili Air) as there is no direct Fast boat from Nusa Penida to Gili Air. The boat was little late while leaving from Nusa Penida. They gave us stickers which we need to stick to luggage and on our T Shirt. They organised our bags well. the journey from NP to PB was not that long. But we had to wait nearly 2 hours as the boat came late from Lombok. When we started boarding they organized the luggage well, Gili T passengers they put luggage separately, Gili A and Lombak they put luggage separately. Pretty good. They had given clear instructions. The journey was smooth and Bumpy but good. Return Journey they clearly mentioned that we have to tell them 1 day before when we to travel. I have seen many people just walk in and asking them to board. They were nice enough to board those people which leads to people standing in the boat lot of luggage. As a traveler we also should know if there are rules we need to follow them. I had informed them one day in advance and my name they put in the Boarding list. Smooth. While boarding there were clear instructions given on Harbor that once we reach Bali we have to go to their office in order to get free shuttle, do not hand over the shuttle pass to anyone on boat. Clear instructions given. I have read about the scam of taxi drivers do on the boat so i was relaxed. In the return journey like i said there were lot of people came at last minute because of which they were standing. I mean there should be some system to be followed by boat company (Thats the reason why i had given 4 stars in stead of 5 :)). Anyways the ride was bumpy because there was lot of rains and sea was a little rough. Sea Sick people were vomiting and the staff was providing them carry bags. We reach pretty much on time. Once we reach PB there were lot of drivers,touts came on boat and asking for taxi service many people give away their free shuttle pass to them (Which later had to pay a lot of money to travel to Bali Main land and these are the same people who will tell that they got scammed. If they follow the instructions they will not see the scam)  Long story short. You will get the service depending upon how much you pay. The return ticket from PB to Gili Air is 500.000 IDR. If you compare that with Eka Jaya or Golden Queen its less. Thats why there are no AC a little crowded. But i enjoyed the travel (I may be lucky) and definitely recommended",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 9, 2020"

In the morning while doing check-in they put on the destination sticker (that goes onto your shirt) Kuta. After we asked why is there Kuta when we are going to Nusa Penida they just said “yes,yes you go to Nusa Penida” and pushed us to the boat. The boat left on time which was the only positive thing. The boat was AWFUL! It was way too overcrowded- people were standing. The boat didn’t have any spare room and was very packed. NO AIR CON/CIRCULATION which is must be with 40degrees. People were vomiting because lack of the air.Now to the scamming part. After many stops(which was a surprise for us as we were told it is direct route) we finally made it to Padangbai. We had to do another check-in in the office there. And surprisingly they said that our ticket is not valid and we cannot go further. After explaining them the situation what we had in Gili T they didn’t believe me so I asked to call the boss. While talking to him he said I am a liar and it is my fault. He ended a call saying “I don’t want to talk to you anymore” with no solution at all. After I asked him to show me the receipt of the purchase with my name/signature/destination (that I had given him in Gili T) he sent me two ‘forged’ paper where even my name was falsely written. The real documents ‘were not found’ and ‘not given to them at all’ although you can’t get any tickets without it.. Of yeah- we asked for compensation which ofcourse wasn’t given and was laughed at.After 1,5h of arguing we were disappointed of everything. All the staff were extremely rude by yelling at us with no reason and repeating that it was all our fault and that we are liars..So we had to cancel all of our plans.

The way I got tricked was through the promise of an open ended return ticket that in the end had a date and time for my return trip.However, what I would like to focus on in this review is how reckless and dangerous they operated the return trip. They first banged really hard on the pier at all stops - that's 3 stops from my Gili T start. These bangs are not the regular soft collision with the rubber padded parts of the pier. At Gili Air they hit something so hard that it knocked a bunch of passangers over and we were all wondering if the boat is ok.And this wasn't the most dangerous side of the trip. When heading to Padangbai, they were riding the waves so fast and hard that basically every 30 seconds you would feel the front of the boat in the air and then it would smash down into the water with a loud bang and pushing you into your seat. That lasted an entire hour. All passengers were sick and dizzy and had their stomach turned upside down.I don't know why they were in such a rush the whole trip, but this felt more like marine training than a pleasure trip.This is not a crew you should spend 1 cent of your hard earned money!

More than a thousand people died. Towards the Sanur side there are two plaques in stone to commemorate the events.For Dutch people perhaps interesting to know that the general in charge of the genocidal 1906 operation Rost van Tonningen was the father of Meinoud Rost van Tonningen, a key leader of the pro-Nazi fascist party NSB during WOII.

697,Padang_Galak_Beach,"THIS IS NOT A TOURIST BEACH. HOWEVER CULTURE FIENDS MAY FIND SOME VALUE.This black sand beach runs north of SANUR’S small but busy harbour. To the eye it looks extremely long but actually the first 2200m to the JEH  AJUNG stream is PADANG GALAK – across river is another 1300m of similar sand named locally PANTAI BIAUNG and PANTAI LEMBERG, but I’m sure most visitors think they are still on PADANG GALAK. I did. At the north end the sand gives way to a rocky foreshore for a few hundred meters to the CAMPUHAN stream after which the sand starts again (often narrow and discontinuous) for several km further.I‘ve walked these beaches twice return (2015/18) from my SANUR hotel to the PANDAWA POINT surf spot 500m past CAMPUHAN R. The sand is hot and not attractive with heaps of rubbish (NO RESORTS to groom the beach). Similarly there’s lots of rubbish in the water – not the most attractive place for a swim. No offshore reef like SANUR’S means ocean swell penetrates making for choppy surf in the onshore winds of dry season and poor surfing waves until PANDAWA POINT’S submerged rocks create a passable wave. There are many nicer east coast beaches for good sunrises.The beach hinterland is not exciting to explore – 75% flat rice farming, a few small residential areas plus scattered warehousing/manufacturing and several Hindu temples behind the sand.So the average visitor will not be whelmed. However, CULTURE VULTURES may find more of interest. While not fitting that label, I’m always interested in local beach culture and found late in the day many Balinese enjoying the sand, wading/swimming, beach or stream fishing and playing beach football.

The boat seemed to be in GOOD condition and seemed to maneuver the waves much smoother compared to the service we took coming in. The crew also spent the first few minutes explaining all safety procedures and demonstrating how to use the life jackets, which is something that was not done on the service we took there.The seats were quite uncomfortable though, as they were made from some hard foam material which is like sitting on a wooden bench, and can get quite agitating when you have to sit like that for 90 minutes. Moreover, the seats had no head rest so you cannot lean back and snooze for a while.Apart from these observations, everything else was pretty standard with nothing really to commend or complain about.About 10 days ago, I was on the VERY SAME BOAT that had an engine explosion this morning, killing 2 people and injuring 13.I can't speak for the people who were on the boat today, but my experience was fairly reasonable.

It was also poorly ventilated and smelled like exhaust, which didn't help with our seasickness on an admittedly rough seas day. They had no safety briefing, and the life jackets seems rather in accessible (tied under a canvas to the roof) in the case of a capsize.

I liked the fact that the price is including a hotel drop-off for several selected places in Bali (check the description). After arriving at the harbour (for us it was Padang Bai) we were brought to our accomodation in a small shuttle-bus with AC. The distribution of all passengers over different shuttle buses went really smooth, so no stress.About the boat itself: ours was quite small, i think around 20 persons could fit in, but this could be because it was low season. Since the boat was small the ride was also really bumpy at open sea, resulting in a higher chance to get a little seasick. A good point: all passengers were provided with a bottle of water.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 1, 2016"

We booked the night before we departed in ubud, and were really confused because so many operators eg ekajaya and scoot have such bad reviews on trip advisor and some shops charge over a million for gili cat.We bought from a little shop opposite the ice cream shop called gelato secrets on Monkey forest road and it was 850,000 return each - so quite a good deal. We were the first to be picked up and he came just after 7. Pick up continued till around 7:30 (as outlined on the ticket) and then we headed to the port. All very organised. In total it did take around 2.5-3 hours. There was a short stop in Lombok, but I think we ended up waiting around a little longer because a load of passengers decided to get off and find a toilet whilst the passengers for/from Lombok were disembarking/boarding. Return journey was smooth and left on time. It took an hour and a half and we were dropped at our hotel. All transfers had AC and they  give you a bottle of water on board and there is also a safety demo. )We also saw the ekajaya boat on our departure and it was packed and you had to clambour along the edge to board!)

(Approximately 12 Euro or 15 US Dollar) Compared with other attractions in Bali this is outrageous as well as embarrassing - epecially as Locals only pay 10.000 IDR.2. The wooden Walkway is not maintained to an appropriate and necessary level:  a. there are dangerous holes and gaps in the wooden planks and some of the planks are so weak that they don’t seem to carry a human being of average weight.                                                         b.

834,Blanjong_Inscription,"In 1932 the Belanjong (also more generically known as Sanur pillar) was rediscovered. The cylindrical shaft is crowned by a lotus cushion. The surface of the pillar is inscribed by the order of King Sri Kesari, with the inscriptions dating back to early 914 A.D. The inscriptions are written in a mix of Sanskrit and Old Balinese, and in two different scripts. Curiously, the part of the text written in Early Nagari script (which is normally reserved for Sanskrit) is in the Old Balinese language, whereas the part written in the script normally used for Old Balinese, is partly in Old Balinese and partially in Sanskrit. This might have confronted contemporaries with problems deciphering the inscriptions, but it is worth noting that inscriptions were often imbued with magic, and the mixture of scripts and language may well have contributed to the magical effect.The pillar is Bali’s oldest artifact and the inscriptions detail the exploits of Sri Kesari, a Buddhist king of the Sailendra Dynasty, and his efforts to lead a military expedition to establish a Mahayana Buddhist government in Bali. The inscription also tells about the success of military expeditions of offshore islands, either Nusa Penida or faraway Maluku. It is the first known inscription in which a Balinese king recorded his name.When one uses Google Maps the Pillar is difficult to find, as the closest road on Google Maps leads to a gang, which ends in the backyard of a private house. When one stands on Jalan Danau Poso facing the Pura Belanjong, the alleyway leading to the pillar is left of the temple (and clearly marked - see photos below).Unfortunately the inscriptions are invisible due to the fact that the pillar is covered with a ceremonial cloth and much of it is underground.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written March 26, 2019"
835,Blanjong_Inscription,"As with many objects of historic importance, this artifact as such is not very appealing. Hidden behind glass and partially covered by a piece of cloth the inscriptions on the Belanjong pillar are hardly visible. Even if you can discern some script, for a non-specialist the writing is almost meaningless.The object comes to 'life' if you read about it. The pillar dates from 914 and contains a written account of a military campaign by a Buddhist Balinese king named Kesari. The writing is in two scripts (Old Balinese and Sanskrit) underscoring the significance of the military action as it was aimed to establish a Hindu-Buddhist society apart from Java.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 16, 2019"

Boat was fine have no complaints about that. When we arrived in Nusa Penida we were put into a taxi with another couple. When we booked this tour it was advertised as a private taxi with air-conditioning. I've no problems sharing a taxi if it's advertised as sharing but why say private taxi when it's not. When we got into the taxi we noticed there was no air-conditioning. The other couple in the taxi with us decided to make a complaint to the head office because we were not going to be stuck in a car with no air-conditioning for 8 hours when it is 30 degrees outside and if we weren't getting a car with air-conditioning we wanted a refund. The manager we spoke to informed us that when we reached the next desitination (broken beach) we would get a new taxi with air-conditioning. When we reached the next destination we were informed that the other couple in the car would be moved to another car with air-conditioning but we would be left in the taxi without air-conditioning.

We explained that we wouldn't off left the harbour if we knew that we wouldn't of been in a car with air-conditioning as advertised in there day trip. We wanted a refund as for the amount we paid we should have been treated better, the manager said that we couldn't get a refund as we already left the harbour.

The drivers did not speak any English and was hard to get any additional information. We were only able to pay in cash which meant we needed to carry in excessive of $1500 to pay for the privilege. We were all loaded into the ferry (not boat) and were required to wait an additional 30 minutes in a very crowded ferry for 2 passengers who were running late!! It was extremely hot in the ferry and many people started to feel unwell. There was no instructions on life jackets or location or any evacuation plan available. On arrival at the island there was very little information on the tour. We were taken to a small room to get our fins fitted. They did not have enough fins to go around and we were told it didn’t matter as “you won’t be snorkelling anyway” we I challenged them that said they can give me a life jacket to swim with instead. The life jackets were in poor condition with broken buckles and tied.During the booking process we were told we would be provided with water, towels, lunch, a guide and insurance. We were provided with 300mls of water each, on request and we asked for more we were told “no more ”!.  Due to no instructions we were required to get changed on the boat. (No one want to see a 50 year old changing into her bathers - I can tell you right now!). The guide told us to stay with him, however did not wait for the weaker swimmers. No towels were provided, until we returned to the island. Be aware There are no toilets stops on the tour boat!Lunch is street food, The menu contained spring rolls -which we felt would be safe to eat, we were told they were sold out. However when paying customers come in they were served spring rolls. On complaining numerous times they served us spring rolls too. All other food was served luke-warm with precooked eggs. The following day 4 people from our party became unwell with vomiting. On returning to Sanur we travelled on a ferry which was in poor condition, with broken seats and  the lock on the front exit was broken so the crew tied the only front exit shut with rope, which would have prevented us leaving the vessel in an emergency. On returning we were transferred back to the hotel as part of the package. Both drivers drove erratically with one driver, on many occasions, driving on the wrong side of the road to pass traffic build up  and drove excessively fast.

They were very kind and even gave me a piggyback to get to the boat dry as my foot has an injury and should not touch the water.Also they carried all our luggage to and from the boat.The boat was on time and the cruise was very calm even though we heard it is better to go in the morning.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 8, 2020"
872,El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"I wanted a day of hassle free adventure activity before I drop to airport for a late night flight from Bali. El Ray organises the boat travel and the tour along with snorkeling activity for a relatively less price. I checked out the reviews on TripAdvisor and was skeptical. But as it have it, I booked two seats for my wife and me for a whole day activity in Nusa penida and airport drop. That too on whatsapp with no prior payment. The day dawned early with Pick up from airport right at 6:15 am ,by ElRay jounior driver Meeko, as was told. Later I did cash payment at the ElRay counter in Sanur. Later had breakfast and we were off on the fast boat to be right on time for a 3 hours well organised Snorkeling experience at four different locations in Nusa penida including the Manta bay. That was followed by awsome American lunch and a 4 hour tour of the island  with a nice helpful and informative guide Komang(photo attached). He was very active in spite of the sun and helped take nice photos at different locations. Later our drop to the island and Airport was right on time. I thank ElRay Junior Travel team for making my last day in Bali very memorable and safe. I would definitely recommend the same to all.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 6, 2019"

874,El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"I booked out tickets to Nusa Penida on El Rey Junior Fast Cruise through Skypenida.After booking I came across a couple of not-so-good google reviews and got a bit worried about our trip.Firstly, you have to walk in the water to get to ANY of the boats leaving Sanur. The harbour is too shallow and there is no pier. How wet you are going to get will depend on how high the tide is and how rough the sea is. In our case, we only got wet up to our knees. I walked in with no shoes. The bottom certainly isn't sandy but it wasn't that bad on the feet.The boat itself was large, clean and comfortable. The crossing was very good and we made good time over to Nusa Penida.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written November 19, 2019"
875,El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"SCAM!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.Pickup at hotel was an hour too late, when we arrived in the harbour they tried to make us pay in cash even though our hotel told us that we could pay by card. Eventually I had to hop on a scooter and drive to the beginning of the harbour to pay with my card. When we arrived at the boat we had to walk waist deep through the water to get on the boat. They asked to put our shoes in a basket.When we arrived at nusa penida our shoes where thrown on the ground where anybody was able to take them. You’ll need to find your shoes while locals are harassing you trying to get you into their taxi. After being delayed for about an hour and a half our driver still needed to fill up the gas tank before we could actually depart.The driver was very young and could not speak english. The only thing he said to us during the entire trip was stuff like, “go there”, “ you have 30 min”, “i wait on the car”.He just started driving without telling us where we were going and how long it would take. But before we even arrived at the first stop, the driver managed to get a flat tire and after an hour we could continue with the spare tire.The spare tire was in a terrible state and when we addressed this to the driver he told us ‘no worries’. Every driver that passed us was pointing at our spare tire and told the driver that it was too flat.We felt very unsafe for the rest of the tour. All the roads are very small and have big potholes in them.After an hour and a half we arrived at our first destination where the driver told us, ‘go there be back in 30 min’ and without even knowing where we were we started walking to the first spot.It was a 10 min walk so we had 10 min to quickly take a picture in a very crowded spot and then needed to walk 10 minutes back to the car.This cycle repeated for the other destination. After the 2nd destination we were driven to a restaurant but the road was so bumpy and the driver was driving so recklessly that everybody felt nauseous and dizzy so not everyone was hungry anymore.The lunch itself was a joke. You can choose between a burger, sandwich and fried rice. Also the drinks are super limited. Fruit juice, water or soda. The lunch was not even worth 2 bucks and during the lunch the staff of the restaurant was staring at us constantly. After lunch the driver tried to rip us off by telling us that we needed to buy an extra ticket of 25.000 rupia p/person, but he could not explain what it was for. We refused to pay and he drove us back to the harbour.And there you will need to show the receipt that you got after paying in sanur harbour. If you don’t have that receipt anymore you will have to pay again for a ticket. They don’t tell you this by the way.After receiving our boarding pass for the boat we needed to walk from the docks into the water where the low tide had exposed the coral. You needed to walk over dead and alive coral to get to the smaller boats that would bring you to the ferry. In order to not rip open our feet we decided to sacrifice our sneakers and keep them on in stead of walking bare feet.From this point everybody noticed that there were only 2 small boats that could bring people to the ferry and with high tide coming in it was everybody for themselves. If you missed a boat you would need to wait knee deep in the water on the next boat until you could manage to get aboard one of them.Once we got back to sanur harbour we again needed to wade waist deep through the water to get ashore.In total we maybe had 1,5 hours to walk around and spend more than 6,5 hours in the car and another 1,5 hours in the boat.Worst trip we’ve ever done and will never do again. Not worth it.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 29, 2019"

We paid at Sanur booth and we were told this included transfer to our hotel.  I confirmed this 3 times and all 3 times I was told ""don't worry, someone will be waiting at the dock to give you a ride to your hotel"". The boat was late boarding and leaving. When we arrived at Nusa Penida and transferred to another smaller boat, I asked a few crew members who I was supposed to meet when we got on shore, they blew me off.  When we got to the beach, the boat was immediately flooded with cab drivers and I wanted to make sure we were picked up (as we'd already paid for transfer to hotel), the 3 guys on the boat I tried asking totally blew me off and the one who understood English told me to just get off the boat and there would be someone there.  We got our bags and kept telling drivers we had paid for transit, so didn't need a ride.  We kept asking and everyone said they had no idea, so we went to the Tanis booth.  There were 5 guys there only 1 spoke English and he said ticket only was for boat.  This was what I had anticipated at the harbor and been assured would not happen.  A cab driver tried helping, calling our contact back on Bali, but everyone said oh no it's just the boat tickets, no transfer.  There was another group of 4 people who were in the same situation, they had paid for boat ticket and transportation to hotel and had no transfer on arrival.  All 6 of us ended up just paying to get to our rooms a second time, but not a great first impression at all.All I can say is have low expectations for service and make sure you get a ticket that shows PROOF that transfer is included, don't just trust there will be someone waiting for you.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 13, 2020"
883,Tanis_Lembongan_Express,Booked to go to Nusa Lembongan on Tanis Express.The crew had zero interaction with the passengers and the boat has one way in and one way out which is a bit scary in the event of a mishap.Coming into NL we suddenly veered right coming off of a wave which the skipper managed to save and then we sat out from the beach for 20 minutes while they tried to fix the problem.It seemed that the steering linkage had broken off of one of the three engines and the engine decided to steer us abruptly right.At no time were we updated on the problem and when the boat started to heat up inside we had passengers starting to feel ill.Eventually they organised for a dive boat to offload the passengers ( approximately 25 people)The crew looked like a bunch of boys on a day trip and gave us no confidence at all.On the way back they used their large boat which had 7 engines on it and it holds about 100 people so the trip was much better.,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 11, 2019"

They drop the people at the airport and then dropped us at Seminyak. We arrived at our hotel at 19h30. We basically waited from 15h30 till 19h30 (4 hour pf waiting), we literally paid 130$ to wait which is super ridiculous. They should have took us in 2 separate groups (Airport / Seminyak).

We spent about 30 minutes looking at his paintings and he took the time to talk to us, pull out and hold up paintings for us to look at. No pressure to buy. He doesn’t yell at you from across the road to come in and buy and he certainly doesn’t chase you down the road to come into his shop. We brought two large paintings from him (1.2m x 1.0m). Starting price was IDR 700,000 ($70.00 AUD) each which is very reasonable. We ended up paying IDR 500,000 ($50.00 AUD) each which is excellent. Similar paintings of the same size are more than double that else where. Maybe we could have gotten them cheaper but the price was fair and they certainly are worth much more than that outside of Bali. Kadek took both canvases off their frame, rolled them up and packed them in a plastic tube for us to bring home. Excellent experience.
