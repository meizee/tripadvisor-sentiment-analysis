28,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"One of our first stops in Ubud and it didnt disappoint, you just have to watch out for the monkey. As I sat down to rest on a wall, I was approached by a monkey who wanted me to hold it. I quickly realized that they work in pairs. One butters you up while the other eyes you up and down to steal your stuff.  While holding the one, another run up my back from behind, sat on my head for a moment beofre pulling out one of my diamond earrings. They love shiny stuff. After much convincing and realizing he couldnt eat it, he promptly threw it back at me. You wouldnt believe it unless I posted the pics which I have. A while later during our walk around the park, we had one jump on us and try to get into my pack. We had left the zipper open slightly and there was a bottle of sleeping pills inside.

30,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"No stay in Ubud would be complete without a trip to its famous Monkey Forest, the name alone sparks the imagination. Its goal of preserving a forested area peppered with traditional buildings and temples all for the purposes of protecting hundreds of families of monkeys is a noble one, and the reverence with which the monkeys are held in (as well as their near-total control of the area) does go a long ways to show this. However, and this is unfortunate, the way the Monkey Forest has been given over to tourists does bring the quality of the experience down. There are signs and constant reminders not to feed, approach, or otherwise interact with the monkeys, and yet a lot of these go unheeded. Because of the influence of belligerent tourists, the monkeys have become a lot more aggressive and demanding in their search for food and other sundries and it definitely leaves a sad mark on the reputation of the site. We saw monkeys stealing cigarettes from one tourist, which is on one hand a great display of karma, but on the other its most worrisome as you know the monkeys are going to have a bad time finding out that cigarettes aren’t edible. The irony that a spot as famous as the Monkey Forest is both thoroughly funded and fundamentally ruined by tourists never fails to give me existential dread. The scenery and imagery of a wild, winding forest full of Balinese statues and temples, themselves covered in cavorting simians is a wonderful sight to imagine when heading out to the Monkey Forest. The reality of a choked and crowded walkway, blocked with tourists trying to tempt juvenile monkeys with sugary treats will forever hold the Monkey Forest back from its real goals.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 7, 2020"

36,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,We loved our visit to the monkey forest in Ubud. We drove on our moped and there was plenty of parking available outside the forest. Tickets were cheap and getting there was super simple. Be prepared to get waved down by people trying to get you to visit the nearby coffee plantation on your way. The monkeys are huge and they can get pretty vicious when fighting. Don’t get in their face too much because you are in their territory now. As long as you are respectful when taking pictures then the monkeys are quite calm. Don’t panic if they try to climb up you as there are rangers there to help. Too tip is to have a padlock in your bag because those monkeys are super clever and we saw them open up someone’s zip bag to steal the contents.

38,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"When we visited Bali, one of us was on crutches with a broken ankle. This made ALL tourist attractions very difficult and tiring to navigate. This was one of the most expensive places to get into but that being said - just getting to see these little guys up close made it so worth it!! This isn't one of those attractions that under-delivers -- you get to see these monkeys running, playing, and stealing things from tourists. It is so fun to see them running freely! We would advise listening to all the warnings about not bringing in food. The monkeys WILL find it, even in a zipped back pack! It might be wise to not take a bag in if you can get away with it. If you're traveling with a person that is injured or handicapped, be prepared for a lot of walking. We didn't get to see much of the forest because it was so spread out and tiring, but what we did see was all ramps and walkways with very few steps which would make it fairly wheelchair accessible.

Only feed them food acquired there at the venue. They LOVE food and will get very aggressive if they see it.  Don't try to tease or taunt them with food. They will come after you.

I booked to see the Janger dance here. It was cheap but I was still expecting a professional performance (in fact I happened to catch a free dance competition for children earlier so I thought it would be that standard or better).What I got felt like an amateur performance or a school play. The dancers weren’t in time with each other and the music, and to be blunt I was expecting younger/slimmer dancers - I wouldn’t have minded if these dancers were good or more experienced but it didn’t seem like it. They also sang, and I’m sorry to say, they just couldn’t hit the notes that were clearly required and so that wasn’t great either. There was clearly some sort of narrative (two men turned up halfway doing half singing/half speaking parts) but no one had provided any explanation sheet or anything so I didn’t have a clue what was happening. Then some kids in the most ‘homemade’ monkey costumes turned up for a bit of audience interaction (shaking hands) - they were cute at least. After about an hour I left, I didn’t want to be rude but it wasn’t getting any better (if anything the opposite) and it seemed pointless to stay when I wasn’t getting anything from it. A few other people left as well so I think my opinion was shared. My tip - try to see legong dance instead. The only good thing about this performance were the musicians who were great.

The trail was easy to both find and follow. We walked up from Ubud through the streets, and up the narrowing roads onto the rice fields and it was certainly worth it! We wore hats and took water with us and managed the walk in our sandals. You would struggle to access this with a pushchair, but it’s certainly not a difficult walk, and is well worth it! We ended at lotus cafe, as we wanted to start closer to where we were staying, and this worked really well. We all loved seeing the stunning rice fields, banana and coconut trees, and the variety of bird life while we walked along the track. We met locals selling coconut oil and fresh coconuts, and were able to see more of local Ubud life. We stopped enroute at Sweet Orange for a drink and lunch; this facade is set amongst the rice fields and in a very tranquil location. The drinks and food were delicious and the staff were all very welcoming and friendly. We stayed for 2 houses enjoying the scenery, shade and cool breeze. We would recommend checking out this place.

There has been change over the years-small hotels and warungs being built and the track being widened to accommodate more motor bikes carrying suitcases, but there are still some beautiful unspoiled sections along the way with very few tourists.This is the circuit we take-walk along Jalan Kajeng and continue up the incline at the very end and head towards Luxe Villas (you can't miss it), continue along until you enter a jungle part and keep going past the new Visea Hotel on the right built into the cliff face. Keep and going until you come to a small, safe bridge-cross to the other side and turn right. You will see an embankment with some rough clay steps, go past this first set of rough stairs to the second set of rough clay steps (2 or 3) that go up the embankment (easy to do- I have completed this with young children). When you reach the top turn left and keep walking until you reach Sari Organic-keep going and you will come out on the main street of Ubud.

At first you follow a narrow concrete pathway and you think your not going on the right direction but continue to follow you will be pleasantly surprised.

191,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,"My wife and I walked through the Kajeng Rice Fields in April 2019. These rice fields are located within easy walking distance of the tourist area of Ubud.  In my opinion, it is a ‘must-do’ experience for all travellers to Ubud.  It allows a wonderful quick relief from the nearby busy tourist area and a wonderful opportunity to see the stunning rice field countryside without going on a tour.  Below is some information that you may find useful:Where is the start of the walk?  We started the rice field walk at the top northern end of the street named Jalan Kajeng.  This street is the first one west of the Palace located at the main intersection of Ubud.  It is a very narrow street so you can easily miss it.  I guess the street is about ¾ kilometre in length – this is the distance you need to travel in order to reach the start of the rice field trail. After about the first 500 metres Jalan Kajeng becomes narrower and narrower; there are no cars at the northern section because there is not the space to turn around.  So if you take a taxi be aware that you will need to walk at least the last 150 metres along the street before you arrive at the start of the Walk.  You know you have arrived when you see the sign ‘Welcome to Juwuk Manis Rice Field Walk. NO CARS ALLOWED’ on the left-hand side. (I personally recommend walking the entire length of Jalan Kajeng just to see a quieter urban part of Ubud.) The Walk. The Kajeng Rice Field Walk that we chose is about 1 kilometre in length. It loops left amongst the rice fields and passes 2 warungs (cafes) before returning to the main road in Ubud  – Jalan Raya Ubud. The exit is about 200 metres west of the Palace.   (There are at least 2 trails available for walkers. The longer trail has a bigger arc before too heading south towards its exit about 500 metres west of the Palace on the main road.)Initially there is a steep gradient of about 100 metres with rainforest on the right-hand side, and a high brick wall on the left. At the top of the hill you will see signs directing you to the ‘SWEET ORANGE WARUNG’. One of the signs said the opening hours are 09:00 – 20:30.  You just follow the concrete  trail and walk past a sprinkling of artist workshops and B & Bs etc.  You pass a small stall on the left-hand side selling fruit. About 20 metres further on there is another SWEET ORANGE sign; turn left here.   (If you turn right I think you will be taking the longer trail.)  Just follow the concrete trail left towards the 2 warungs.)The trail to the warungs is mainly concrete; after the warungs the trail is compact soil.The exit point for the shorter trail is about 200 metres west of the Palace at the main intersection; if you want a landmark, the exit is next to ‘The Paon’.  It is about midway between the Daily Baguette and Casa Luna on the opposite side of the main road.  Of course, you could start the Walk here instead of the top end of Jalan Kajeng. Just be aware that the 2 warungs are a little easier to access from the top end of Jalan Kajeng. The exit becomes a very narrow passage way leading onto the main street.  The only way a tourist would notice it is because of the sign at the exit on the street that reads: ‘SUBAK JUWUK MANIS (Magical Rice Fields in Ubud)’.  Without this sign no tourist could know that rice fields exist just a few hundred metres to the north of the main streetHow difficult?  I’m 66 years of age with a reasonable level of fitness and had no difficulty at all.   The trail though could be a challenge in parts for the elderly, or parents with young children.   The first 100 metres consists of a fairly steep incline but is definitely manageable; when tired, just rest at intervals before resuming the climb.  This means that it is possible for nearly anyone to walk to either of the two warungs that are located about 300 metres from the starting point at the top of Jalan Kajeng.  The trail is mostly flat. However, towards the end the trail could be difficult in parts. There was one section consisting of a couple of feet where the path had collapsed; a wooden plank has been placed there to allow transit.  Care must be taken because at this point there is a sharp drop within a couple of feet down the left-hand side to a ravine far below. It can be negotiated easily for fit adults provided care is taken. Further along there is a steep set of concrete stairs.  Some locals ride their motor bikes on the trail; they didn’t pose any danger as they are driven slowly. Be aware that motor bikes are unable to be driven on this last section of the trail.  Duration.  It took us 2 1/2 hours to walk along Jalan Kajeng and the trail (total of almost 2  kilometres). However, this takes into account dining and chatting with backpackers and local stall holders selling fruit.  An uninterrupted Walk would probably take about 1 hour.Best Time to Go?  If you want to hike the full length of the trail I recommend you start early at, say, 7am, or even earlier, or at 4pm in the afternoon. Do not go in the middle of the day because it is too hot and humid.  Note that the Sweet Orange Warung opens at 9:00am. Scenery?  The scenery is stunning.  Relax at one of the warungs and enjoy the views, the birdlife and maybe the sunset.  Along the trail you pass a few local farmers and there is an artist’s workshop in the last section.  What should I bring? Water! Because of the heat and humidity. Preferably good walking shoes. Hat. Umbrella – preferably a large one suitable for the tropics. A torch is essential if you plan to be on the trail after sunset.   Insect repellent is a good precaution if you intend to be hiking at sunset.  Cafes?  There are two cafes along this trail – the Dicarik Warung and the Sweet Orange Warung.  They are located close together. We dined at both on separate days. I recommend both but prefer the Dicarik (which also provides Cooking Lessons – always a good indicator of food quality).  Is this walk the best in Ubud?  Yes.Popular?  We encountered only a handful of tourist – mainly backpackers - along the trail.   Highly recommended.  Experience stunning scenery for free!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 19, 2019"

Two things to be aware of before heading to check out one of Ubud’s most iconic waterfalls are these: the stairs and the weather. We took the stairs from the main entrance of the site down to the river that the waterfall flowed into, and whilst the way down wasn’t that bad, the way back up was a workout we were was not ready for at that time in the morning.

There is no charge for motorcyclists. Lockers & toilets are available but chargeable, as well.Walking a few steps ahead after getting our tickets, we were greeted by a very large signage of “Welcome to Tegenungan Waterfall”. Along the way to the waterfall were shops selling food, drinks, swimming paraphernalia & souvenirs. Since we were pressed for time & I had some ankle issues, we walked to a viewing point area or location. From there, we could see a full view of the Tegenungan Waterfall from afar. There were many people at the waterfall. We could also see a wedding photo opportunity taking place! We took quite a few photos of the waterfall in the background surrounded by a lot of greenery & rocks before leaving. It was quite surreal. I could almost feel the cooling water on my skin.The waterfall may be categorised as a small one but its gushing water is undoubtedly very strong. The water that plunges into the pool below is not very clear. However, it does provide a cool respite against the hot weather around the year. Since it is not very high, you can find thrill-seekers jumping off the cliff despite having prohibitive signs around. The water may not be deep enough to cushion the jump downwards.Further reading suggests that one must walk down approximately 150 concrete wide steps with safety rails before reaching the waterfall area.

The cave itself isn't that deep (it's a T-shaped chamber), but there are other things to see, so don't turn back when you have seen the cave.

There are two paths, an easy and more difficult option. We chose the more difficult but it was still manageable with little experience. We were also joined by Ketut for the hike who assisted Marley in getting our group of four to the top. Once up there Marley cooked us a breakfast and we waited for sunrise which didn’t disappoint. We then headed down the easier path and jumped in the car to the hot springs. Perfect after the hike that morning.

The hike up was a little strenuous but we had a great time, and one guide stayed with our faster hikers in the front and the other stayed with the folks who needed a couple of breaks going up. The sunrise was stunning and 100% worth the hike, and the guides made sure we got to a spot with a great view. Watching the sun come up was followed by a second breakfast (everyone in our group was pleased by how often we were fed and very satisfied with each meal!). Our fast paced (set by us 😄) hike down was ridiculously fun. We hope our guides had as much fun as we did, we really enjoyed joking around with them. We went to the hot springs pools next, which were so perfect after the hike, and the setting is stunning. The tour finished up with one more meal, which comes with an absolutely crazy view over a relatively recent lava flow and the lake.

He wanted to display his personal collection of art pieces for the purpose of education, research, information and inspiration to future generations of artists. The artworks range from Balinese Traditional Style (showing episodes from traditional Indian and folk literature using fine ink details), Ubud Style (using watercolour, oil and acrylic to illustrate the beauty of lines and strength of the style in broader themes like agricultural scenes, religious ceremonies, musicians and dancers), Batuan Style (expressive and vibrant with detailed features and fine lines that somehow appeared to be dark and mysterious - focusing themes on folktales, legends and daily life), Indonesian Contemporary Art, and works of late Dutch-born Indonesian artist Arie Smit in 6 halls.

I'd advise checking the quality of the clothes before buying, I noticed holes in a few of the dresses I picked up, luckily before I'd bought them.The famous basket bags that you see everywhere, in various patterns and colours, were selling for around 200,000IDR.

Tip: DO NOT ask 'how much?' unless you are sincerely interested in buying something, and you better be ready to bargain because you'll get the 'tourist price' that will magically drop to almost half the moment you walk away. Don't mess around with these Balinese - they are not the same as the people that serve you at other places. They are cut-throat business wheelers and dealers. So BE sincerely interested in buying something before you waste their time asking 'how much' then follow these rules of bargaining:1. Always smile and keep things light2. Come back at half the asking price, always3. Know the number you're really willing to buy the thing for before you even start4. Don't say 'ok' say 'no' and be willing to walk away until you hear a reasonable price5. Be willing to walk away.6. Be sincerely interested in the piece of crap before you ask for a price for it!7.

Everyone is assigned a personal guide to explain about the Luwak cats, their harvesting methods and traditional roasting.  It is very scenic and beautiful with the valley and vegetation surrounding you but don’t let this fool you, calling this a plantation is a real stretch. I didn’t see more than 5 coffee plants and less than 10 cats in total. There’s no way they would be able to produce anything on a commercial level supplying the souvenir store with their product.  This place is more for taking pictures (swing and nest extra$)and Instagramming your experience, and I’m almost 100% sure tour companies and drivers get a kick back from bringing in visitors.

If you want good coffee or maybe just decent coffee, there are plenty, PLENTY of wonderful espresso bars all over Ubud that take coffee seriously.  I ended up purchasing the avocado coffee and dark chocolate out of guilt for the free tour and samples they provided us. Upon arriving home, I opened up both products to try. Neither product was edible. The coffee had specks of instant coffee granules in a mountain of powdered creamer and the chocolate tasted nothing like chocolate, more like a bar of palm oil. Also both products did not list their ingredients. Red flag #2.  I would have been so embarrassed had I gifted these as souvenirs.  Everything in their store was astronomically over inflated, I feel duped and cheated.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 14, 2020"

This isn't a coffee plantation per se but they have it set up well for tourists. Walking through you are able to see all the type of fruit trees they have in Bali including mangosteen, snake fruit, jack fruit etc. I found that quite interesting. Once you settle in for the tasting they bring out 15 or so free samples of their coffee and tea. If you want a cup of luwak coffee you will have to pay $50K. All of their tea and coffee was specular!

We came for the famous Luwak coffee and of course you will have to accept that they need to keep Luwaks to be able to produce at this level. We were happy to learn that they only capture the Luwaks to feed them chicken and coffee beans. Not only did the captured Luwaks have big cages and ""nests"" for sleeping, they were also being released into the wild again after one week. Then the ""Poo Hunters"" search the forest every day for the processed poo. This is for not stressing the animal out and produce the coffee in the most harmless way possible. They even have a pet Luwak who just sleeps the day away on its pedistal right outside the shop. They show you how coffee is made step by step and you can even try roasting some coffee beans yourself. They provide a free coffee and tea tasting at their café, where you have a splendid view over the jungle. We could honestly have spend hours here.

The paintings comes in a variety of sizes and styles/themes - landscapes, traditional, dancers, modern art, etc. I do not claim to be an expert on the subject, but IMHO most of the paintings appeared to be significantly better than all that we had seen in the markets - both in terms of quality as well as uniqueness.Walking through the various rooms, the wife and I zeroed in on (love at first sight, actually) one of the paintings by a local painter of some repute. The initial ask was for IDR 8 million - it took the salesman a couple phone calls to get the artist to agree to our final quote of IDR 2.4 million. The billing process was then quite swift, and the packaging thorough. I was worried about whether the PVC pipe would hold its shape for the duration of our travel, but am glad to say that it did.We are now back in India, and cannot wait to get this up on the wall!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written July 16, 2019"

554,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"Do yourself a favour and go here first before you try buying art from street shops and wannabe galleries. You will realise the difference instantly. Quality, presentation, collection of art work is so different than what you see on streets.It also helps that it's all artists under 1 roof  are selling  their art together giving the cooperative a commission on sales. I could have easily spent a full day here talking to the various attendants on the art they were selling and discussing artist's lives. Must be approx 700 paintings on display.So the attendants are basically Balinese artists themselves who make traditional art. They sell their art along with an assortment of all genres. You see them making art in front and also in end halls where more traditional artwork is hung. Multiple halls featuring various genres will just transport you into Bali and its culture and artist's perspective of how they see Bali.I ended up buying quite a few pieces.Frames are free so if you want, they will dismantle and give them to you. They also meticulously pack everything. How is the art priced: They know you are a serious buyer if you are coming here so the prices are for sure higher than street galleries but do the Bali bargaining thing and start from one third the price. Having said that, I didn't see any of the artwork I bought in any of the galleries. We tried almost 7-8 shops in Ubud and Seminyak but didn't find a single piece that was similar.They tell you they will call the artist directly and if the price is ok, the art work is yours.Our guy did call multiple artists in front of me and we negotiated on a final price before paying.Loved the experience and loved everything I bought.So sweet of them to serve my mother some balinese coffee when we requested.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written April 23, 2019"

557,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"Located in the Ubud area is this large art gallery that includes two separate building displaying traditional Balinese and modern/abstract paintings.  Our tour operator described this artist cooperative as the best painting sales location  in Bali.  We were impressed by the variety of the work some of which was by new artists trying to establish themselves and some of it by masters who have established themselves as the standard to which the new artists are trying to match.  Prior to entering the main building a few artists were demonstrating their artistic skills.  The shop/studio has a wide range of styles and small to very large paintings.  We wanted to purchase one very nice painting but the very large size (6x4 feet) would not fit on any wall in our house--the price was very reasonable for the piece which was then purchased by one of our friends.  The shop does not ship but they do remove the painting from its frame, carefully roll it up with tissue paper and insert it into a stiff cardboard tube enclosed at both ends.  They take all credit cards.  The display frames are not included in the quoted price.  Discounts are available if you ask--20% is typical but it also depends on how long they have had the piece.  The individual artist actually sets the price but I suspect that a comparable piece would cost 90% more in the states in an art studio.  Certificates of authenticity are given for the master artist paintings.  If you are a collector this is the place to visit for a Balinese painting.  It is also interesting to wander into a back room where you can watch the staff prepare a painting that has been sold.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 18, 2019"

The gallery is located in front of a beautiful royal home with temples, done in classical balinese style, which is now available for young artists to learn the craft while staying there. The Gallery itself is housed in many small and big rooms, connected with each other; just when you think you are done, you find another room with even more paintings ! There are hundreds of paintings in different styles. We were blown away by some Abstract paintings, made by the Artist who showed us around, I Wayan Merta ( Roy ) , and his Guru, Dukuh Kardiyesa, The prices are quite reasonable ! Roy was a delightful person, lovely to talk to, and patiently showed us around, and put absolutely no pressure to buy anything. We spent a good two hours in our first visit, and were allowed to take photos of paintings we liked, to get a second opinion from others in the family. We retuned later in the day, thinking we would by 3 paintings, but ended up buying 10  ! Roy and his team patiently removed the canvases  and rolled them carefully, layering each with craft paper, and finally rolled them inside a PVC pipe, attached lids at both ends, sealed firmly with Duct tape. They also made it easy to carry by attaching a handle made from plastic tape. Though the package was around 7 feet long and weighed 15Kg., We had absolutely no problem checking in the oversized package with Malaysia Airlines, along with other oversized wood sculptures we had also bought, since the combined weight of our checked in luggage was under 40Kg each ( in Business Class) .

If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that.

First time I’ve seen that at a temple (of any faith). Later, I asked my driver why and he replied “Tourists”.  What a shame.

And we'd rather go for a walk on Campuhan ridge. However, fortunately, the path of Campuhan ridge leads directly to Gunung Lebah Temple. As we came back it was already clear, that the celebration would be spectacular. The whole temple shone in the afternoon jungle like a gem, and it was clear that if we want to see the temple, the time is right now. We had Sarongas (as always in Bali) with us, but on ceremony time it is still needed sash and udeng. So we bought some more souvenirs and went to the temple.The following text is not so much about the Gunung Lebah Temple, but rather about Sabuh Mas.

The holiday is held all over Bali so it's just about coming at the right time.So many colors, flowers, lights, decorations I've never seen together in one place! Plus the scent of incense, flowers and fragrant stinks. Hypnotic rhythmic music and singing. Endless processions of beautifully and festively dressed people with prays, sculptures. The atmosphere here was absolutely fantastic and it was one of the most striking experiences we experienced in Bali. And even during these celebrations are local very friendly. I guess that I had to look really strange with my shorts, cheap sarong and camera.

Because it is little known, there are far fewer people on this path and a huge plus, no scooters.  The paddy is one of the most emerald around Ubud, a real visual joy.  And the path leads to Sweet Orange Warung, one of the best hidden gems around.  Just before you get to the Warung, there is a congenial old couple selling coconuts for only 10k, a nice cool down from the afternoon heat.  But a problem if you are going to eat, because it will fill you up.  Just past the Warung the path is paved over and turns hard right behind some villas before rejoining the main path going back to Jalan Kajeng.

It is almost completely lined with palm trees, making for lots of nice shade, which is needed in that Bali heat.The entrance to this walk is just before the Puri Lukisan Museum. Turn Right at the wooden sign that says “SUBAK JUWUK MANIS (Magical Rice Field in Ubud)”. You will be on a tiny, narrow, sometimes steep path following the wall of the museum for about 3 minutes, before it pops you out into the promised “magical rice fields”. Another 5 minutes up the path, and you will pass the adorable Sweet Orange Warung. If you continue the path and follow the curve, you will come to a point where you can decide to turn Left or Right. Going right will lead you out to Jl. Kajeng, which will eventually take you back out to the main road, Jl. Raya Ubud. This makes for a quick 30 minute trip (start to finish), but only half of it (~15 min) will be spent in rice fields area. The other half is on Jl. Kajeng.If you prefer to spend more time in the rice fields, I suggest taking the Left after the curve instead. This path dead ends into the jungle with a large, steep ravine to your left. So you will have to turn around and double back on yourself, but it allows for another 15-20 minutes of walking in the fields before heading back out into the madness of central Ubud. *NOTE, you CAN technically make your way through the jungle at the north end of the path to eventually find yourself on the other side of the ravine. This is the other, more popular rice field walk, where Sari Organik is. BUT, we only made it over there because a local came by eventually and saw that we were lost and lead us. The path is not well trodden, and after following her through, I feel confident in saying that there is 0% chance that we would have made it there on our own.

You see women working on the rice fields (in June). Half way you have a possibility to take a rest and you can buy a fresh coconut with a farmer or warung (shop). Choice 1: Then you can downwards, cross over a little bridge and go to the other side. Walk along the narrow concrete edge of the little irrigation canal. Keep following this path, and see the big cement tiles lying with names. Then you come in the Jalan Kajeng. Choice 2) Another possiblity is to follow the footpath at the upper side of the coconut farmer. It is much further, about 5 km extra, but very nice.  You see more rice fields, coconut trees and painter artists. At the end, you want back to Ubud, you have to follow the road on the right hand.  Then you will seen a brand new hotel: Pyramids of Chi, then you see Cafe Bintang, after this you come along Pura Dalem Bentuyung Temple. Walk further and you come thru  a few desa's , finally you come in Ubud at the Traditional Art.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 4, 2017"

A while later, we hadn’t finished our meal the staff gave us the bill to pay.Not happy about the service, i asked to talk to their manager, and the manager sent a representative (someone else) to apologise.So disappointed, ruining my beautiful day in Bali.The art gallery itself is ok, few interesting local painting, but with poor lighting ( dim, and warm toned light) hard to see the original colour of the painting and make it difficult to enjoy.Has 4 different building, only one has AC, and one was closed when i was there.Pengalaman pahit kujungan ke Museum Puri Lukisan @museumpurilukisan .Hari terakhir di Ubud, Bali. 21/11/2019.Saya dan keluarga mengunjungi Museum ini, tiket nya sekitaran 140rb-150rb ( kurang ingat tepatnya berapa) per orang dan sudah termasuk makan siang buffet.Pas kami masuk ke restaurant nya, disambut dengan bahasa inggris dan ramah. Lalu saya menjawab mengunakan bahasa Indonesia.Pada saat itu lah aku merasakan suasana nya berubah. Kami diarah kan ke meja makan lalu dibiarkan bergitu saja, tidak ditawarin minum, tidak dikasih menu, dan tidak diarahkan.Saya pun berinisiatif untuk minta menu minuman, dan di kasih begitu saja lalu pergi meninggalkan kami ( padahal restoran juga sepi dan mereka ngobrol-ngobrol saja), saya panggil staff nya lalu order minuman. Beberapa saat kemudian, kami masih belum selesai makan, di sodorin bill, SO RUDE! 😡🤬. Pada saat itu jam 1pm an, kami baru sekitar 30 menitan disana dan restaurant nya tutup jam 3pm. Aku samperin karyawan nya dan mau meminta penjelasan perlakuan mereka terhadap kami. Aku request untuk complaint ke manager mereka, tp dikirim wakil (orang lain, bukan manager nya) dan hanya permintaan maaf tanpa penjelasan yang memadai.Mungkin kami dari kampung, dan tidak berpakaian mewah, tapi kami bayar dengan harga yang sama dengan tamu lainnya, kami behaved and good manner people.

Quite a few paintings were individually interesting.  Some of the really old stuff painted on cloth was fascinating though dull and fainted.  The problem is that it is all the same.  Demons, Ramayana legends, kings dead in ritualized battles, black magic goddesses.  It all becomes one, monotonous and stultifying.  There was not a single canvas that made me stop and say, “oh wow.”  An incestuous and homogeneous culture does not seem to allow for any individual expression.  In the end I was passing from picture to picture without interest.  Also every picture is so busy that you could spend ten minutes with each one, yet all are thematically repetitive.  Careful.  The lady tried to sell me a 145K ticket which is exorbitant.  When I questioned it, she said it included lunch - which I did not want.

813,Sari_Api_Ceramic_Studio,"Traveling solo I was looking for things to do in Ubud. This was a pretty good day well spent with Agus at Sari Api. It brought back a lot of memories from studying ceramics in high school. Agus took the group of 3 through the 3 hand building techniques followed by time on the pottery wheel. Agus makes it look easy but it in fact is quite challenging. It was still fun and Agus was very helpful. I made 4 things, 1 slab, 1 coil, 2 on the wheel, and have organized to have 3 of them, that I liked, shipped back to Australia. Agus will fire them multiple times and apply the chosen glaze and send them on over. I will see them in 81 days! 👍🏼The only snag was the location of the studio. It was super easy to get to via taxi or motorbike but getting someone’s attention on the way back was a little tricky. I was super lucky to get a lift back to town with people from the class.

816,Sari_Api_Ceramic_Studio,My husband and I were on a visit to Ubud and came across Sari Api. We did a one day on the wheel course and it was great. We had no previous experience with ceramic but enjoyed the setting and had fun playing with the wheel doing both a few bowls and cups. Thio Agus was our instructor and he was quite good in explaining to us the basics and giving us plenty of time on the wheel. We felt that Angus could have been a bit better at explaining things but overall were very happy with the class and with what we made!It was really great that we were able to leave our ceramics with Sari Api to dry and glaze. Following this process Sari Api sent them over (we paid AUD$50 for shipping). The shipment took a long time but it was worth it.

817,Sari_Api_Ceramic_Studio,"I emailed Suzan about wanting to work on the wheel and said I was happy to do either a group or private workshop. She wrote back saying there was a group workshop available a couple days later. I assumed that it would be sort of tailored to everyone's interest. It was more generic -- we did two hours hand building and 45 minutes on the wheel, which is okay as I was open enough to doing some hand building. Agus was nice and clearly a very talented potter but the class had a serious tone to it, and was perhaps a bit boring if you have done pottery before. So overall the workshop was okay, not great, but not bad either.The main disappointment I felt was that we were told our pieces would be ready in roughly three weeks, but when I called the studio after 3 weeks Agus said there hadn't been enough business to even do a first firing as they were waiting for more pieces so it would be a further 3 weeks. I am leaving in a week so he offered to ship them to Ireland for 50 dollars (!!!) which is as much as the workshop itself. I understand circumstances change but they easily could have emailed me about this. The glazing and firing are included in the workshop price, so it seems to me their responsibility to contact people if they are not going to do it. I've done plenty of other pottery workshops in Oz, Canada and Ireland and they have been cheaper, more fun and you get to keep your trinkets!",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written March 17, 2017"

On the other hand my gf is quite competent and received little advice/help since the guy could see she knew what she was doing. At the end he says it's $80 (aus) (whatever that is in rupee, I'm from aus and everything was marketed towards australians/tourists), I try to reason that it was advertised as $40 for a beginner class, and $10 for a free session if you know what you're doing and don't need help. So $50 right? Nope, he won't take any of it, despite him barely talking to my gf.Anyway I'm not too fussed, it was near the end of our holiday and we were somehow under our budget so ok. Also he said he would post our works to us once they were fired so we left our addresses, and emails (we would have to pay for postage, he said once they were ready to be posted he would email us and we could pay with bpay or something, no problem, I thought my bowl was sick and just wanted to use it!).That was three months ago, since then I've sent them two emails, called numerous times but they rarely answer the phone. On two occassions they picked up, asked for my email and promised they would be in contact asap. Neither of us have received an email.I advise you find a better place for pottery because these guys are a joke. Their prices are just ridiculous too.

I am coming to Bali for almost 11years now,  and today I went this morning to the Bintang Supermarket in Ubud to buy Mangosteen tea,  I bought 9 packages, because I love this tea... It's a really nice, easy to brew instant tea. But, when I opened it at my hotel. And brewed it, it looked. Like brown dirt and smelled like moldy dirt. I had to spit it out, when I tasted it.  I opened another package, this time same brand from Bintang supermarket, it was Lemongrass tea,  same smell, same taste, same color. I went back to the store and complained, but first they didn't want to let me talk to the manager, even they remwbwred mw, even the cashier greeted ne and remembered me. After a while,  after demanding the manager over and over again, he came, and told. Me, when I bit this product, I should know the taste. Yes, I know the taste, that's why I brought it back. Even he realized it was rotten, after smelling it... Still no money back.......... I had to fight for 1 hour and a half..... 9 packages comes up to almost 30dollars at 45 ooo rupees a piece.... Sorry I dont have the money to throw away in the toilet. Don't buy these teas there... And don't buy the coffees there,  there is a reason why locals don't buy there.......

I hoard coffee directly from Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and now Indonesia, as well as I travel with our Nespresso machine with sleeves of our favorite coffee. Although the Colombian coffee is probably my favorite, my Colombian friends are even enjoying the Bali brand more. I have taken some of the Luwak coffee to some of the most discerning drinkers here in NY and looking forward to their feedback. Suffice it to say, this is a fun place. My undergrad degree is in Biology and learning about the botany of the robusta and arabica, vanilla, cocoa plants; anatomy & physiology and behavioral habits of the Luwak; agribusiness of coffee plantations in Indonesia; medicinal properties of hibiscus, lemongrass, ginger, turmeric, mangosteen, etc.; and the taste comparisons made this probably the most intellectually rich experience to had on all of my travels to over 70 countries.

From the parking it was a walk past rice paddies, an art shop and cafe. Further down the path there is a small waterfall. The site itself is quite small but very scenic and interesting. Before going through the gates at the entrance you will need to put on a sarong (these were offered at the entrance - as we brought our own with us, I am not sure if this would be a charge or not). If you are interested in the history I would recommend getting a guide as there is little information at the site. There is a small temple at the end of the carvings, this is why you should wear the sarongs in this whole area.This is close to Goa Gajah, we did not this when we visited Goa Gajah.

1059,Pura_Samuan_Tiga_Temple,"Since I stay with Balinese friends in Bedulu (=Bedahulu village), the Pura Samuan Tiga is more or less ""THE TEMPLE"" where the family goes for celebrations. This year was a big 12 days celebration from April 17th to 29th with all kind of activities. People from many communities around the Ubud area bring their holy temple symbols (the Rangda costumes and masques, the Barong, the temple shrines and others) to the temple to be blessed. They bring incredibly huge offerings (towers of fruits, rice cakes and decorated with ornaments made from young palm leaves and flowers) which get blessed with holy water by the Hindu priests. The intent sticks and some money on top are for the temple, the beauty of the colors and smells are for the gods, the edible parts are take home again for the family. There are Gamelan orchestras playing, people moving and singing and priests reading from the holy scriptures. Our friend took us for two evenings to the temple (dressed in the usual temple dress: Sarong, Blouse and Selendang for the ladies, Sarong, Shirt, Selendang and Headdress for the males and sandals or flip-flops on the bare feet). On the first afternoon we saw the processions of the different Banjars (communities) arrive with their temple things and circle three times the area of Samuan Tiga. Then there was the run of the ladies (long black skirts, white blouse, red selendang) and men (all in white) around the temple. They hold hands and run in waves symbolizing the waves of the sea. After three rounds the men take from the heaps of discarded decoration and put the dry palm leaves like hats on their heads. After one more round  they sit in front of the priests to get blessed and then hit each other with the dry palm leaves. This symbolically drives out all bad thoughts. Now the temple and the people are cleansed and ready for the arrival of the goods. (Physically - in our eyes - the temple is more dirty than ever, rubbish laying around everywhere.) In the evening the school children and some ladies show special dances in beautiful costumes accompanied by Gamelan music. Again, the beauty of the dancers, the dances and the music is mainly for the gods, not necessarily for the onlookers, who talk, eat, come and go and let their children play. It is definitely not a show in our sense. Everybody who wants to look stands or sits crosslegged somewhere on the floor.If there is no ceremony, the temple is just a big area of stairs, temple shrines, and the huge holy banyan trees.

It is cheaper and more hygienic. This temple differs from other Bali temples in that there are 7 courtyard compared to the normal 3. The innermost courtyard is supposed to be the meeting hall of gods, deities and saints. Here there are numerous shrines compared to other inner courtyard of Balinese temples.

The temple is 5km from Ubud and offers the peace and tranquillity the more remote larger temples offer away from the city, and you don’t have to fight your way though a plethora of people selling souvenirs.The temple was built 10th century and was the sacred royal temple of the Warmadewa dynasty.  Tiga = three and Samuan = meetings, it is believed it is the “venue for the great meeting of the gods, deities, and saints”.  The temple has seven courtyards instead of the usual three.  The banyan tree near the entrance is stunning.  Much of the temple was destroyed by earthquake in 1917 and was rebuilt by Bali’s beloved architect, I Gusti Nyoman Lempad, whose many achievements also included Pura Taman Saraswati in Ubud.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written July 13, 2017"

We googled info on this place as we had no money left for a guide. Tip: all temples you need to be respectful and follow the local traditions. These are holy places that have a significant connection with the locals. Please ensure you:Cover up modestly and wear a sash or sarong when entering a templeDon´t enter a temple with an open wound. Women shouldn’t enter a temple during menstruation.Pay extra respect to people attending the temple for religious purposes.Sarongs can be rented or bought outside most of the popular temples; at some it might even be included in the entrance fee. If you plan to visit a lot of temples, consider buying a sarong of your own.  Be aware this is the same across the entire island.The seven-courtyard large temple was originally built in the early 11th century, but was destroyed in the earthquake of 1917 and has since been rebuilt. Not many tourists stop here, so you can enjoy a calm and peaceful atmosphere in the temple.Pura Samuan Tiga is located at the Bedulu village, close to the Elephant Cave and the Yeh Pulu, making it easy to combine the three sights into one trip.Don’t forget to inspect the main gate designed by one of Bali’s most influential architects and artists I Gusti Nyoman Lempad.15000 rp for adults and half that for kids to enter",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written March 17, 2017"

Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives.

Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it.

Also, I attended with my partner, and it turned out to be the loveliest experience to share with him. It was so bonding and loving to get to share such a profound and opening experience and see and support each other in this deeper place. I read many reviews here about how wonderful it is, but I don’t think a million reviews can explain it, you must experience it! First, the practices and information that Alex offers in the morning portion are really invaluable, it’s a great balance of explaining the technical, scientific part and diving straight into experiencing and practicing, and a perfect preparation for jumping into that ice! Alex creates an extremely safe a supportive space for everyone in the group, really being present, sharing his breadth of knowledge but also allowing for what is there in the group, for what might come up. The second part of the day really shouldn’t be missed! The place is so very special and to get to practice such sacred ceremonies so connected to the earth and after getting to such a grounded and open place from the morning activities, it was truly a magical time and experience. I really felt so released, cleansed, renewed, and ready to open a new chapter with such fantastic tools to take with me.

He took time to explain the way traditional keliki is done, step by step & the time take to complete each piece of art. I am truly impressed with the pride Wayan Gama takes to paint his masterpieces and the noble effort he takes to teach his students for the preservation of the traditional Keliki painting skills & culture. Students as young as 7 years old begin their journey as a painter under the tutelage of Wayan Gama. Their work are absolutely amazing and I bought 2 beautiful paintings from Wayan Gama's gallery. In my next visit, I hope to buy more of the unique pieces. The pieces are certainly not cheap, but reasonable. Direct purchase from the artists themselves would definitely be cheaper than those found in commercial galleries around Bali.

In fact, the access alley was also an entrance to an inn of some kind, so people were walking by with their suitcases during the performance. That took away a little of the experience, but the performance itself was enjoyable. I had studied this form as a theatre student many years ago, so I really wanted to go. The story was not the typical Ramayana one, so I couldn't follow it, but the handout was helpful, explaining the story is of Rwa Bineda.

You are encouraged to go into the shop and buy stuff but it was quite expensive (by Bali's standards) but I didn't begrudge buying a few things because it was free to get in/we'd got free drinks. I bought bath salts for my mum and she said they were lovely, so that's good.On the other hand, I felt really uncomfortable seeing animals in cages and others that people were just taking photos of. That made me a bit sad and I just felt like I wanted to leave.

Well this is not the case, the 100% Luwak 50gr coffee costs 260k from them and in all the shops in Bali from 120k to 160k, so it costs 100k more from them. Same thing for tea, they charge you 90k and in all the shops it's from 20k to 45k maximum.

This is not where they grow their products, they have a plantation far away somewhere but the plants that are present are only there for the tour. After that the tour guide sits you down at a picnic table and brings a medley of teas and coffee, all of this is completely FREE! Trying the Luwak coffee will cost you a whopping 50,000RP (3.5USD). I didn't find it to be special, just a nifty novelty that you might as well try since you are there and it could cost up to $100 a cup in the US. The tour guides are extremely friendly, and do not push you to buy anything, so one could technically go in and out without spening a dime.

We tried paintings and woodwork at the usual spots like Ubud market, Sukhavati market, Tegallalang market, South Ubud, but nothing quite hit the spot in terms of quality and/or price. In fact, most of the paintings in the markets were just mass produced and lacked the uniqueness that we were after.After miles of driving looking for wall art that day, our driver suggested a visit to the Semar Kuning Artist Cooperative - and am I glad he did! The place is essentially a coming together of various local artists - the 'salesmen' are also artists themselves. Prior to entering, we were requested to not photograph any of the paintings.The cooperative is housed in an old mansion with room after room of paintings hung from the walls.

The initial ask was for IDR 8 million - it took the salesman a couple phone calls to get the artist to agree to our final quote of IDR 2.4 million.

Quality, presentation, collection of art work is so different than what you see on streets.It also helps that it's all artists under 1 roof  are selling  their art together giving the cooperative a commission on sales. I could have easily spent a full day here talking to the various attendants on the art they were selling and discussing artist's lives. Must be approx 700 paintings on display.So the attendants are basically Balinese artists themselves who make traditional art. They sell their art along with an assortment of all genres. You see them making art in front and also in end halls where more traditional artwork is hung. Multiple halls featuring various genres will just transport you into Bali and its culture and artist's perspective of how they see Bali.I ended up buying quite a few pieces.Frames are free so if you want, they will dismantle and give them to you. They also meticulously pack everything. How is the art priced: They know you are a serious buyer if you are coming here so the prices are for sure higher than street galleries but do the Bali bargaining thing and start from one third the price. Having said that, I didn't see any of the artwork I bought in any of the galleries. We tried almost 7-8 shops in Ubud and Seminyak but didn't find a single piece that was similar.They tell you they will call the artist directly and if the price is ok, the art work is yours.Our guy did call multiple artists in front of me and we negotiated on a final price before paying.Loved the experience and loved everything I bought.So sweet of them to serve my mother some balinese coffee when we requested.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written April 23, 2019"

Our tour operator described this artist cooperative as the best painting sales location  in Bali.  We were impressed by the variety of the work some of which was by new artists trying to establish themselves and some of it by masters who have established themselves as the standard to which the new artists are trying to match.  Prior to entering the main building a few artists were demonstrating their artistic skills.  The shop/studio has a wide range of styles and small to very large paintings.  We wanted to purchase one very nice painting but the very large size (6x4 feet) would not fit on any wall in our house--the price was very reasonable for the piece which was then purchased by one of our friends.  The shop does not ship but they do remove the painting from its frame, carefully roll it up with tissue paper and insert it into a stiff cardboard tube enclosed at both ends.  They take all credit cards.  The display frames are not included in the quoted price.  Discounts are available if you ask--20% is typical but it also depends on how long they have had the piece.  The individual artist actually sets the price but I suspect that a comparable piece would cost 90% more in the states in an art studio.  Certificates of authenticity are given for the master artist paintings.  If you are a collector this is the place to visit for a Balinese painting.

The gallery is located in front of a beautiful royal home with temples, done in classical balinese style, which is now available for young artists to learn the craft while staying there. The Gallery itself is housed in many small and big rooms, connected with each other; just when you think you are done, you find another room with even more paintings ! There are hundreds of paintings in different styles. We were blown away by some Abstract paintings, made by the Artist who showed us around, I Wayan Merta ( Roy ) , and his Guru, Dukuh Kardiyesa, The prices are quite reasonable ! Roy was a delightful person, lovely to talk to, and patiently showed us around, and put absolutely no pressure to buy anything. We spent a good two hours in our first visit, and were allowed to take photos of paintings we liked, to get a second opinion from others in the family. We retuned later in the day, thinking we would by 3 paintings, but ended up buying 10  ! Roy and his team patiently removed the canvases  and rolled them carefully, layering each with craft paper, and finally rolled them inside a PVC pipe, attached lids at both ends, sealed firmly with Duct tape. They also made it easy to carry by attaching a handle made from plastic tape. Though the package was around 7 feet long and weighed 15Kg., We had absolutely no problem checking in the oversized package with Malaysia Airlines, along with other oversized wood sculptures we had also bought, since the combined weight of our checked in luggage was under 40Kg each ( in Business Class) . The package arrived intact, and we have given the paintings for framing.We will love to go back to Bali soon, and will certainly visit the gallery again, if only to meet Roy, and see the new works.

If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that.

If the parade of breasts is too much for your lady companion, their are beautiful birds in the lovely garden, including nearly extinct white starlings.  The paintings are calming and colorful if rather mono-themed.  Young Balinese women still shed their shirts without modesty inside family compounds, but not in public.  Out in the fields one might come upon an old topless granny.  No portraits of these for Senor Blanco.  His women all have fantasy forms, hard to live up to for anyone in real life.  The grounds, the vegetation, the classical music, everything was beautiful.  Tip.  Outside the second story patio are two winding staircases to the roof that look like they should have “do not enter” signs.  But they don’t.

Antonio Blanco definitely had both talent, originality and a great sense of humour. No doubt you will note the similarity with another Catalan artist; Dali! The frames around his paintings are not to be missed as they works of art in themselves but admirably integrated. Be sure to read the text in the painting; some are hilarious! There are portraits and occasional still-lives, but Blanco had a very obvious veneration and love for women and their curves, which he was kind enough to share! The very erotic ones are in a separate room, away from children. The Foundation also acts a bird sanctuary, a worthy cause, and part of the 100.000 Rps entrance (which includes a light welcome non-alcoholic drink.) will also be caring for the birds.I warmly recommend this 45- 90 minute visit depending on how much of the artists humorous text you read!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 23, 2019"

We had Sarongas (as always in Bali) with us, but on ceremony time it is still needed sash and udeng. So we bought some more souvenirs and went to the temple.The following text is not so much about the Gunung Lebah Temple, but rather about Sabuh Mas. If you are lucky enough to stay at Bali at the time of this holiday, do not hesitate and go to the nearest temple. The holiday is held all over Bali so it's just about coming at the right time.So many colors, flowers, lights, decorations I've never seen together in one place! Plus the scent of incense, flowers and fragrant stinks. Hypnotic rhythmic music and singing. Endless processions of beautifully and festively dressed people with prays, sculptures. The atmosphere here was absolutely fantastic and it was one of the most striking experiences we experienced in Bali. And even during these celebrations are local very friendly. I guess that I had to look really strange with my shorts, cheap sarong and camera. But everybody just smiled, greeting me ... just occasionally guided me slightly when I went where I really should not.I really do not know how the temple looks empty and in the day, and I do not care. What I experienced here during Sabuh Mas was absolutely fantastic.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 9, 2018"

Because it is little known, there are far fewer people on this path and a huge plus, no scooters.  The paddy is one of the most emerald around Ubud, a real visual joy.  And the path leads to Sweet Orange Warung, one of the best hidden gems around.  Just before you get to the Warung, there is a congenial old couple selling coconuts for only 10k, a nice cool down from the afternoon heat.  But a problem if you are going to eat, because it will fill you up.  Just past the Warung the path is paved over and turns hard right behind some villas before rejoining the main path going back to Jalan Kajeng.

It is almost completely lined with palm trees, making for lots of nice shade, which is needed in that Bali heat.The entrance to this walk is just before the Puri Lukisan Museum. Turn Right at the wooden sign that says “SUBAK JUWUK MANIS (Magical Rice Field in Ubud)”. You will be on a tiny, narrow, sometimes steep path following the wall of the museum for about 3 minutes, before it pops you out into the promised “magical rice fields”. Another 5 minutes up the path, and you will pass the adorable Sweet Orange Warung. If you continue the path and follow the curve, you will come to a point where you can decide to turn Left or Right. Going right will lead you out to Jl. Kajeng, which will eventually take you back out to the main road, Jl. Raya Ubud. This makes for a quick 30 minute trip (start to finish), but only half of it (~15 min) will be spent in rice fields area. The other half is on Jl. Kajeng.If you prefer to spend more time in the rice fields, I suggest taking the Left after the curve instead. This path dead ends into the jungle with a large, steep ravine to your left. So you will have to turn around and double back on yourself, but it allows for another 15-20 minutes of walking in the fields before heading back out into the madness of central Ubud. *NOTE, you CAN technically make your way through the jungle at the north end of the path to eventually find yourself on the other side of the ravine. This is the other, more popular rice field walk, where Sari Organik is. BUT, we only made it over there because a local came by eventually and saw that we were lost and lead us. The path is not well trodden, and after following her through, I feel confident in saying that there is 0% chance that we would have made it there on our own.

A while later, we hadn’t finished our meal the staff gave us the bill to pay.Not happy about the service, i asked to talk to their manager, and the manager sent a representative (someone else) to apologise.So disappointed, ruining my beautiful day in Bali.The art gallery itself is ok, few interesting local painting, but with poor lighting ( dim, and warm toned light) hard to see the original colour of the painting and make it difficult to enjoy.Has 4 different building, only one has AC, and one was closed when i was there.Pengalaman pahit kujungan ke Museum Puri Lukisan @museumpurilukisan .Hari terakhir di Ubud, Bali. 21/11/2019.Saya dan keluarga mengunjungi Museum ini, tiket nya sekitaran 140rb-150rb ( kurang ingat tepatnya berapa) per orang dan sudah termasuk makan siang buffet.Pas kami masuk ke restaurant nya, disambut dengan bahasa inggris dan ramah. Lalu saya menjawab mengunakan bahasa Indonesia.Pada saat itu lah aku merasakan suasana nya berubah. Kami diarah kan ke meja makan lalu dibiarkan bergitu saja, tidak ditawarin minum, tidak dikasih menu, dan tidak diarahkan.Saya pun berinisiatif untuk minta menu minuman, dan di kasih begitu saja lalu pergi meninggalkan kami ( padahal restoran juga sepi dan mereka ngobrol-ngobrol saja), saya panggil staff nya lalu order minuman. Beberapa saat kemudian, kami masih belum selesai makan, di sodorin bill, SO RUDE! 😡🤬. Pada saat itu jam 1pm an, kami baru sekitar 30 menitan disana dan restaurant nya tutup jam 3pm. Aku samperin karyawan nya dan mau meminta penjelasan perlakuan mereka terhadap kami. Aku request untuk complaint ke manager mereka, tp dikirim wakil (orang lain, bukan manager nya) dan hanya permintaan maaf tanpa penjelasan yang memadai.Mungkin kami dari kampung, dan tidak berpakaian mewah, tapi kami bayar dengan harga yang sama dengan tamu lainnya, kami behaved and good manner people.

I enjoyed the contemporary art exhibition enormously and the historical aspect of the establishment of the museum was interesting and both described and portrayed well. The art works themselves did seem to have few variations over the four pavilions and that meant that I did skim, rushing toward my lunch rather than taking time to appreciate.

Quite a few paintings were individually interesting.  Some of the really old stuff painted on cloth was fascinating though dull and fainted.  The problem is that it is all the same.  Demons, Ramayana legends, kings dead in ritualized battles, black magic goddesses.  It all becomes one, monotonous and stultifying.  There was not a single canvas that made me stop and say, “oh wow.”  An incestuous and homogeneous culture does not seem to allow for any individual expression.  In the end I was passing from picture to picture without interest.  Also every picture is so busy that you could spend ten minutes with each one, yet all are thematically repetitive.  Careful.  The lady tried to sell me a 145K ticket which is exorbitant.  When I questioned it, she said it included lunch - which I did not want.

She wrote back saying there was a group workshop available a couple days later. I assumed that it would be sort of tailored to everyone's interest. It was more generic -- we did two hours hand building and 45 minutes on the wheel, which is okay as I was open enough to doing some hand building. Agus was nice and clearly a very talented potter but the class had a serious tone to it, and was perhaps a bit boring if you have done pottery before. So overall the workshop was okay, not great, but not bad either.The main disappointment I felt was that we were told our pieces would be ready in roughly three weeks, but when I called the studio after 3 weeks Agus said there hadn't been enough business to even do a first firing as they were waiting for more pieces so it would be a further 3 weeks. I am leaving in a week so he offered to ship them to Ireland for 50 dollars (!!!) which is as much as the workshop itself. I understand circumstances change but they easily could have emailed me about this. The glazing and firing are included in the workshop price, so it seems to me their responsibility to contact people if they are not going to do it.

On the other hand my gf is quite competent and received little advice/help since the guy could see she knew what she was doing. At the end he says it's $80 (aus) (whatever that is in rupee, I'm from aus and everything was marketed towards australians/tourists), I try to reason that it was advertised as $40 for a beginner class, and $10 for a free session if you know what you're doing and don't need help. So $50 right? Nope, he won't take any of it, despite him barely talking to my gf.Anyway I'm not too fussed, it was near the end of our holiday and we were somehow under our budget so ok. Also he said he would post our works to us once they were fired so we left our addresses, and emails (we would have to pay for postage, he said once they were ready to be posted he would email us and we could pay with bpay or something, no problem, I thought my bowl was sick and just wanted to use it!).That was three months ago, since then I've sent them two emails, called numerous times but they rarely answer the phone. On two occassions they picked up, asked for my email and promised they would be in contact asap. Neither of us have received an email.I advise you find a better place for pottery because these guys are a joke. Their prices are just ridiculous too.

Suzan really is a wonderful teacher- she explained everything clearly and was more than patient and very encouraging.  Suzan is a lovely woman- she has lived in Ubud for 15 years and is really interesting and very well humoured, she made this experience great for me- I was intimidated by 'the wheel' prior to doing her class. The setting is lovely, only 3-4kms from the town centre in a nice cool workshop set amoungst a nice green garden. Due to limited time in Ubud we only did a half day class (3 hours = 350,000Rp, inclusive of materials, clay, glazes etc) and she is posting our work back to Australia for us for a reasonable rate- If you have ever wanted to try pottery please contact Suzan- her class is a wonderful introduction to pottery for the novice and a great experience for the more seasoned potter :-)",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 9, 2011"

I am coming to Bali for almost 11years now,  and today I went this morning to the Bintang Supermarket in Ubud to buy Mangosteen tea,  I bought 9 packages, because I love this tea... It's a really nice, easy to brew instant tea. But, when I opened it at my hotel. And brewed it, it looked. Like brown dirt and smelled like moldy dirt. I had to spit it out, when I tasted it.  I opened another package, this time same brand from Bintang supermarket, it was Lemongrass tea,  same smell, same taste, same color. I went back to the store and complained, but first they didn't want to let me talk to the manager, even they remwbwred mw, even the cashier greeted ne and remembered me. After a while,  after demanding the manager over and over again, he came, and told. Me, when I bit this product, I should know the taste. Yes, I know the taste, that's why I brought it back. Even he realized it was rotten, after smelling it... Still no money back.......... I had to fight for 1 hour and a half..... 9 packages comes up to almost 30dollars at 45 ooo rupees a piece.... Sorry I dont have the money to throw away in the toilet. Don't buy these teas there... And don't buy the coffees there,  there is a reason why locals don't buy there....... In my experience : rotten products and temperex Expiry dates. Beware!!!!!!!! Pictures of the dirt tea,  closeup, and the supermarket attached. The manager didnt even apologize....!

Well, for me the old paintings were like an evidence of the sophisticated and intelligent of the Balinese art   The lower floor hosts contemporary arts, not my taste.

1795,Pura_Samuan_Tiga_Temple,"Since I stay with Balinese friends in Bedulu (=Bedahulu village), the Pura Samuan Tiga is more or less ""THE TEMPLE"" where the family goes for celebrations. This year was a big 12 days celebration from April 17th to 29th with all kind of activities. People from many communities around the Ubud area bring their holy temple symbols (the Rangda costumes and masques, the Barong, the temple shrines and others) to the temple to be blessed. They bring incredibly huge offerings (towers of fruits, rice cakes and decorated with ornaments made from young palm leaves and flowers) which get blessed with holy water by the Hindu priests. The intent sticks and some money on top are for the temple, the beauty of the colors and smells are for the gods, the edible parts are take home again for the family. There are Gamelan orchestras playing, people moving and singing and priests reading from the holy scriptures. Our friend took us for two evenings to the temple (dressed in the usual temple dress: Sarong, Blouse and Selendang for the ladies, Sarong, Shirt, Selendang and Headdress for the males and sandals or flip-flops on the bare feet). On the first afternoon we saw the processions of the different Banjars (communities) arrive with their temple things and circle three times the area of Samuan Tiga. Then there was the run of the ladies (long black skirts, white blouse, red selendang) and men (all in white) around the temple. They hold hands and run in waves symbolizing the waves of the sea. After three rounds the men take from the heaps of discarded decoration and put the dry palm leaves like hats on their heads. After one more round  they sit in front of the priests to get blessed and then hit each other with the dry palm leaves. This symbolically drives out all bad thoughts. Now the temple and the people are cleansed and ready for the arrival of the goods. (Physically - in our eyes - the temple is more dirty than ever, rubbish laying around everywhere.) In the evening the school children and some ladies show special dances in beautiful costumes accompanied by Gamelan music. Again, the beauty of the dancers, the dances and the music is mainly for the gods, not necessarily for the onlookers, who talk, eat, come and go and let their children play. It is definitely not a show in our sense. Everybody who wants to look stands or sits crosslegged somewhere on the floor.If there is no ceremony, the temple is just a big area of stairs, temple shrines, and the huge holy banyan trees. Certainly worth seeing as well, but nothing in comparison to celebration times and preferably guided by somebody who knows about the meanings, like for example our friend, guide and driver I Nyoman Darna from Bedulu.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 1, 2019"

Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives.

I’ve been a TM meditator for 3 years and have done yoga for 6 but, believe that this breath work is the quickest way to process and release the trauma stored in the body. 3 weeks later I still have done this simple but helpful breath work every day. The ice cold plunge was an incredible high, it woke up my body, helped me deal with some of the fear. I was impressed everyone in the group stuck in it. Lastly, we were taken to this beautiful sanctuary in the rainforest. I don’t want to give too much away about it for others who go on this trip but the waterfalls and the cave was so beautiful and spiritually healing for me.

Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it.

What I did not know and not expect is that part of the show is in English! The puppet master tries hard to entertain the audience and is willing to answer questions after the show. He also gave us a chance to look at and to touch the beautiful puppets.

The music is the same as the music I have heard when primary school children are unsupervised in a music class and they are all competing to make the loudest noise.  The story makes little sense and the only reprieve were the battle scenes where many puppets died.  My advice is to try and find another shadow pupppet performance.

We went to the center of Ubud and asked about it, and we were taken by a ticket seller to this one instead. It seemed so odd, like on a patio in an alley. In fact, the access alley was also an entrance to an inn of some kind, so people were walking by with their suitcases during the performance. That took away a little of the experience, but the performance itself was enjoyable. I had studied this form as a theatre student many years ago, so I really wanted to go. The story was not the typical Ramayana one, so I couldn't follow it, but the handout was helpful, explaining the story is of Rwa Bineda. The best thing for us, was that the puppeteer did little comedy sketches and used English when he did so. His bit about the art of ""bargaining"" was hilarious. I'm so glad I went to see this.

On arrival i was greeted by him at the entrance to his Jungle after walking through his organic garden, with his dreadlocks hanging near to the floor and a big healthy organic smile.Instantly i knew that this was the ideal place for me.Slowly walking up the steps into my treehouse accommodation trying to take in all the jungle and nature around me.The treehouse was unreal! So simple so unique! It drops off probably 20m from the balcony into the deep jungle with a river and waterfall at the bottom!Waking up at 6am with a very slight few strips of sunlight shining through the jungle canopy, it was torrential rain and i had never felt ever before the pure deep form of mother nature like that! Laying in bed with the large glass windows in front dropping off into the deep wet jungle!The sounds of running water and birds,frogs,monkeys literally i did not want to leave this moment.3hours later i finally prized myself out of my trance to start the course.Breakfast was a huge tray of fruit all from the garden then a main course of salad and ubi (potato) all obviously grown by hars and picked early morning by Hars while i was daydreaming into the jungle haha.What i learnt from this dude was not just how to grow great organic food but how to live in this world with the ecosystem and not against it, also how to create a ecosystem on my land in Sumbawa that was partly destroyed by corn farming. His information was golden and his mission in life (to save the ecosystem and work with nature) also to educate the word on how to grow organic food and to work with nature not against it.Using his own techniques and also others from hundreds of years ago.Basically he is a all time hero and the course was very beneficial to me and my family to create a new life over in Sumbawa living from the land and working with Nature.The course was supposed to be 2 days but i booked a extra day in because there was so much i wanted to learn!Overall i done 3 days 4 nights there, the three hour course a day was not really enough for me to take everything in, ideally i would like to take a week course 8hours a day haha but obviously Hars has a life too and to steal his time that much just wouldn't be fair.When i left he kindly gave me over 30 different types of herbs and strains that i could bring with me to sumbawa.Now all i need to do is keep them alive and spread hars knowledge to others who are grownig using monoculture techniques destroying the ecosystem.Thanks Hars and good luck with your future project in Sumba!Peace joy and healthy food Sir",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 27, 2020"

Selected the ""sugar free"" variety, but when we got home it tastes, and looks, like nothing more than Aeroplane jelly crystals. There are no ingredients listed anywhere on the package and I was unable to find them on their website. Definitely just a gimmick, tourist attraction and the animal cruelty was too much. I'm disappointed and would not recommend this place to others.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written October 7, 2019"
1990,Teba_Sari_Bali_Agrotourism,"Animal cruelty!!! The Luwaks are kept in a cage for tourist viewing. When I expressed my concern, I was informed they are there for a week and rotated. The had a small platform to rest on. They also have an owl with it’s leg tied to a rope for tourists to take photos with. This poor nocturnal bird is awake and screeching all day, unhappy and then stored away in a box overnight. I should have walked straight out of there. We were given teas to try for free. Then sold at a ridiculous price 230,000rupiah for a small bag. It is just powder similar to jelly crystals. No ingredients listed on packaging. Rip off!!

The free tasting of coffees and teas was a sugar fest - all very sweet. I bought a ""sugar free"" pack of mangosteen ""tea"" for $10. When we got home it turned out to be a 100 grams of what looked like pink sugar crystals, no leaves or plant material evident. I tried a few grains - It tasted like a child's sweet.
