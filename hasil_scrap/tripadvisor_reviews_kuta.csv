5,Waterbom_Bali,"We had a awesome day in Waterbom park. First, they give you a wrist band that you can charge and buy food, drinks, etc. in the park. If your wrist band is still charged when you leave. The rest of the money will be returned to you. It is a large water park with high water slides. One of the best parts is the lazy river that sleeps on the tube and the flow of water moves you in a green direction. There are a number of cafes and fast foods there. We used massage there, they were not professional but it is good for the park. Spend a full day at Waterbom,  it 's a lot of fun.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 18, 2021"

The food was so great and well priced - I really appreciate how environmentally friendly it was too - the food served on banana leaves (including the little dipping sauces). The smoothie I had was the best I’ve ever had anywhere! The slides were so much fun. And safe!! The staff were all so attentive and friendly and professional. Amazing. The showers and toilets were so clean and nothing like other public pools I’ve been to anywhere in the world. The lazy river was so awesome and relaxing. I don’t have kids but I could see so many great rides and pools for the kids to enjoy! I could not speak more highly of the experience we had. People should not complain about the entrance fee and costs of food and drink etc. (my amazing hot dog chips and onion rings was 85k - it’s cheap!!) We pay a LOT more in Australia for our water theme parks and this one is just as if not more deserving to warrant the entrance fee it charges. It’s a bargain in my opinion!! Especially if you pay online before you go. We are so lucky as tourists to have the Balinese people provide us with places like this one. They truly are beautiful, hospitable people. Thank you very much. Ps - it would be nice if people would refrain from smoking cigarettes whilst there - seeing as there are kids around. They wouldn’t get away with it in Australia so it sucks that they think it’s ok to do it here. There definitely are certain groups of Australians that give us a bad name in Bali.

195,Bali_Sea_Turtle_Society_BSTS,So disappointed but I suppose it can’t be helped...!! I spent quite a while researching the different places to go and see turtles while staying in Bali. After reading reviews on Turtle Island and Turtle Conservation in Seregan we chose to visit BSTS. We were dropped at the entrance to Kuta beach and walked along and couldn’t see anything... we asked a local information desk to help and he told us we’d see a giant turtle. On waking back we saw a giant turtle and building covered in tarpaulin. We looked around for a good 10 minutes to find someone to help us but no one was there at all (even though doors were open) we then asked a gentleman sitting on a chair out the front who’s response was no turtles... we only took that to mean it was closed so we left. I’d looked online and on their FB page and there were updates and images so all looks very professional. On arrival is very dingy and looks a little bit of a mess. They have recently updated their FB to say they do not have any turtles to release for a while... this would have been updated earlier as we traveled to the area to see them. With a place like this communication on online fronts need to be at its best so people are aware of what’s going on and when.

237,Bali_Sea_Turtle_Society_BSTS,After reading some of the bad reviews on here it makes me extremely angry- some people attending during April/March hoping to see baby turtles? The hatching of baby turtles is between June to September so of course theres going to be no baby turtles there. The baby turtles are only put in the containers right before they are to be released and this is so they can be transported to the sea. The work the society does is amazing- they move the eggs off the beach from harms way (as tourists and locals use the beach and the baby turtles would be stood on/ could not hatch) and into the giant turtle where they are looked after and kept under they hatch. This way they can hatch safely. They are then put in the water buckets on the day of release. I was lucky to be in kuta on a day of release. it was an amazing experience being able to release a baby turtle into the sea.

Instead you can plunge is a pool a water in between the rock during low tide.2. No nice bars with fancy cocktails if that’s your speed.3. There were heaps of Chinese couple having professional photo shoots and their loud photographers can kill the vibe a bit. 4.

I mean, I saw all the cool photos of it being near the airport runway and seeing airplanes land and stuff. The plan was have some dinner around the beach and then get a cab to the nearby airport after thatI mean, it is a nice beach and seeing the plans land is pretty cool and makes a nice photo. BUT HEED THIS ADVICE, HAVE A PLAN TO GET OUT!The beach is filled with seafood restaurants catered mainly towards tourists. There were busloads of tourists being ferried to the area for dinner. Prices at these restaurants are not great for the budget traveller. There is a fish market with a few stalls catered more for the locals, but many of them require you to buy your own fish at the fish market and bring it to them to cook. It was too time consuming for us who had a flight to catch. Also, many of these local stalls close quite early, like 7pm. So okay, we thought, lets just get to the airport and find some food there instead. But we had a hard time getting out of the area. All the tourists had their tour buses to bring them back to their hotel or what not, but for us we had nothing. There were no taxis in sight, and we all the Grabcars we got kept cancelling on us (we saw signs that they were not allowed to pick passangers from this area). We walked the dark streets inland to try and find a taxi, but there were none in sight. We thought we might miss our flight. We finally chanced upon drivers in Bali who'd sit at the side of the road asking tourists if they needed transport (this is a common sight at touristy areas in Bali). We were NOT in a touristy area and I think they weren't really expecting us, but since they saw us they offered us transport at a slightly inflated price but we took it anyway since we didn't have much choice.So, nice beach but do plan ahead.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written June 19, 2018"

Two other Masses on Christmas Eve and three on Christmas Day and an expectation of similar crowds. In speaking to a couple of the ladies distributing literature, they advised that worshippers come from all over the island and the nearby islands including from as far away as Java. They also advised that the Catholic Church is afforded great tolerance and assistance and freedom of worship. The service lasted 1.5 hours, excellent choir, celebrants with very good English language skills, priests and nuns distributing communion wafers, ushers helpful and very considerate towards the elderly attendees. There was quite a number of tourists present and, like us, were greeted with a friendly smile and welcoming handshake.

698,Matahari_Kuta_Square,"I love Mata Hari at Kuta Square. It invites you to enter the shopping mindset of the domestic tourist. Prices are so reasonable, luckily, because there is no bargaining here. All fixed prices. The way you pay for your selections, the way they are wrapped, all of this is different to the western way. No speed shopping here. There is everything you need, all under one roof. The iconic department store. You begin by parking underneath. Then you emerge up the stairs with the modest, but more that adequate supermarket to the left, and souvenirs to the right. If it was local fashion that you have come for, or rather nice locally made footwear, then you go to the first level. You wont believe the prices. You will probably buy heaps of things you will ever wear because the prices are minuscule. Getting things paid for and packaged is another story. No one is in a hurry here and please insert some extra steps into the process. If you keep going up you will find toys, mainly and some sporting goods. The trick to succeeding at this style of shopping is to collect everything you think you want to purchase in one hit and then do the paying and wrapping thing. If you to and fro you will become exhausted and annoyed.

The adjacent supermarket as well has many products you may want to buy, but prices here as well are high. For instance I found cheese almost 50% cheaper at the Gelael supermarket.I am still not used to the name Matahari being linked to a store. Matahari in Malay means eye of the day or sunrise. It was also the stagename of a Dutch exotic danser who lived in the Dutch East Indies with her husband, a military man for some time. She divorced him and became a famous danser and courtesan in Europe. In 1917 she was executed in France after being accused of spying for the Germans.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 4, 2019"

Wish that I could say the same, a number of blokes of comparable size browsing the men's area, unfortunately, if above 3XL you're out of luck so we all had a bit a grumble when we got talking. Such a shame as there was a great range of men's clothing displayed. I find the ground floor the best, excellent range of souvenir and craft items and helpful assistants. The supermarket section is excellent, a great range of fruits, snacks and drinks to take back to tour hotel room and you will save serious cash by Bali standards. The store is much improved over the past year or so particularly the service.

They will check you have emailed them when paying as you need to book the day before, it’s just an email.We have been here before, and nothing has changed. The lounge chairs have the same dirty cushions, the toilets / change area is not practical, nowhere to put clean clothes etc. The kids play area, I went up on the ship, the ‘safety’ rubber mats had mostly disintegrated and were all over the place, worse trip hazard, and the stairs were dangerous. I did not see a staff member go up once in the hours that we were there, and I honestly doubt they ever do. The mats over the bridge are also a trip hazard, and are there because they have used tiles which are slippery. I slipped but caught it, my daughter slipped and fell hard - the tiles are all the way around the pool.There were not enough blowup seats for the boring floating river that nobody does, or the rides. If you managed to get one, it didn’t last and they all have slow leaks.This is a “plus plus” place, and you get a wrist tag at the start you load with money to spent inside. You can get a locker, $1 or $2 and lounge chairs are $2.5 for two hours. You can rent towels etc. The prices are good.There are a few more food places open, we didn’t order here since the food was so bad last time, just had some French fries for a snack. We saw one family had to take food back as it wasn’t cooked properly.The rides were slow and there isn’t enough water flowing down them. I did do the U ride a couple of times, that was fun, but my floaty thing went down. If it’s sunny be careful as the plastic ride can burn your bottom, as the water only flows down the middle of the slide.There is nobody here, so there are no lines for slides etc. locals get in for a fraction of the price, but hardly any of them come either.There will be a photographer that takes photos of you and your children, they try to get you to buy them at the end. One photo is like $10 printed, if you can get the whole lot on CD for $15. We did that a few years ago as there were some good photos. Didn’t do this year, so not sure what the prices are like.Long story short, this place is a 4th rate water park that needs just a few dollars spent on it to make it great.

We spent no more than 2 hours here before we left due to boredom!!!Size: about the size of half a football field. In total 11 individual kid slides and 8 slides for kids above 130cm. One small pool depth 130cm and one addling pool depth 50cm. One single food court area with capacity for 3 food places but only 2 occupied. A lap pool at the back for some reason (which costs extra), a tiny 100m long 'lazy pool'. Park appearance: looks like someone bought an abandoned water park a week ago and turned the water on. The slides are fading and crumbling, the food court is deserted. There are no lounges in the park to lie on apart from 6 that can be hired. There are a hand full of gazebos that can also be hired.Quality of attractions: Terrible!! Of the 8 adult slides 3 did not have enough water running down them to make you able to go from top to bottom without pulling yourself along. For the kids slides, 3 put of 8 were the same. The kid pool was too shallow for anyone over 3 yrs old but then the restrictions on the adult slides meant no one under 8 could go on them. This leaves the 3 to 8 year olds with nothing to keep them entertained. Anyone above 8 would be bored by the slides that do exist for them. You can't slide down any of the slides with your young one because the pool at the bottom is only 50cm deep.There were hardly any life guards when I went. About 2 for the whole park. Staff gave the appearance of a water park on the brink of going out of business.Facilities: got a free towel hire token, free ice cream token, free soft drink token and free locker hire token on entry. You can only access the locker once. So it is not something to keep going in and out of.Cost: yes it's cheaper than waterbom. Probably by half. But it isn't like this is half as good as waterbom. This is less than a 10th as good. We were the only westerners there when we went. And the park is not aimed at westerners. There are some signs that haven't been translated. We were stared at by some of the other occupants who were probably surprised to see us there. When we arrived at the park it looked closed. There was no traffic and the entrance is hidden a little. Overall impression: to say this park is a disappointment is a massive understatement. My 6 year old and i were bored within 2 hours. If I had known it was this bad i would have paid for an extra day at waterbom or gone to almost any other activity. Do not go here ever.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written August 12, 2018"

We've been there twice and always during the day since we were looking for the sun and we noticed the locals mostly come in the afternoon when the sun's a bit down so we always experienced the park quiet and almost for just ourselves. Drinks were sold at reasonable prices unlike at Waterbom. Gazebo rent also available.

On our last boat ride back to Bali we waited about 4,5 hours for a boat to take us from the island, because the agency forgot to add us to the morning boat, so there was no place left... and we had to take an afternoon one, which arrived evening.... then upon arriving to Bali, they wanted to cram us into big buses of 30 people to be driven to our final destinations... our hotel being one of the last on the list...

The boat was smaller than the two big operators (Eka Jaya and Blue Express) bur still good sized and handled the waves fine.  The only knock is that the  shuttle transfer service, which was included, had almost no air conditioning.  With the bad traffic, it made for a rather uncomfortable ride.

Well, we pay a lot of money (70 euros return each) so we expect to be on time at least.to be honest it's better if you just take a taxi to the pier, buy your boat ticket there and same for the return because I don't think this is worth it to book.also the return in the speedboat was awful, lots of people threw up, and it was nothing to do with the sea but more with the captain driving skills...anyway next time, i will organize my pick up and drop off myself!",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written October 14, 2019"

The staff on the boat were friendly and helpful, we all got a bottle of water and donut and sea sickness pills and bags were given out for free too. My advice would be: 1) you get a better deal booking at the Gili Gili Office in person compared to online (we paid less for the way back by going to the office on Gili T vs online booking when in ubud). 2) they are responsive over WhatsApp where we queried which boat we would be on (the website warns you may be swapped onto another boat if there aren’t many bookings). They also confirmed we could be picked up from our hotel for free which wasn’t central in ubud. 3) Although a free hotel transfer from Padangbai to Sanur was included in the ticket price, there are people trying to persuade you to pay for private transport from Pandagbai because they claim the journey will be a LOT longer than it really is - we found this was not at all the case and were glad we stuck with the free transfer.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 27, 2019"

Naturally, because of this, we did a hellllll of a lot of research and review reading. We chose Gili Gili Fast Boat because for the price and the reviews we decided it was the best one for us, and I am very glad we picked them. For the most part it was very organised, clear of our route (Gili T - Gili Air - Bangsal - Padang Bai) the staff were lovely, funny and communicated well with us about the journey and the included transfer at the other end, we left pretty much on time, getting people off and on the boat was fairly speedy and the boat was very new, clean and sturdy. The staff went through a safety briefing and handed out water, sea sickness pills and a donut.We were very lucky with the weather, barely any chop at all so we flew through very smoothly and the aircon was fine - maybe a tiny bit too warm but not too bad at all. Leg room isn't great (but I'm quite tall) but still not that much of an issue. For someone who is quite uncomfortable on small boats in the open ocean, this journey was a delight for me.The missing star is because when we arrived in Padang Bai, the area is quite small and between all the cars, vans, people waiting, arriving and departing there was confusion on which transfer we should be on and ended up having to switch vans, and this van was veryyyyy hot and the driver had to hunt around for ages trying to find a petrol garage while we all sweated in the backseats.Would travel with them again though for sure!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written September 9, 2019"

Also, every passenger had a safety kit under their seat.In our pre-research of this trip, we read about many previous travellers who had a bad experience with the shuttle from Padang Bai. However, it was obvious that Gili Gili was aware of all these bad companies that try to fool all tourists arriving with the boats by leading them off to the wrong shuttle bus/car when entering Padang Bai, which resulted in that the staff of Gili Gili was super super clear when informing us about our specific shuttle. In other words, as long as you follow the Gili Gili staff’s instruction you will be perfectly fine and don’t worry about leaving your ticket to the staff on the boat, that’s part of their organising process.We were very happy to go with Gili Gili and would recommend everyone else to do the same!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 27, 2019"

908,Tuban_Beach,"SOME PARTS NOT BAD – SOME JUST FAIRTUBAN is the area between KUTA and the AIRPORT. Once a separate village, it’s now part of the urban agglomeration stretching 12KM from the airport to CANGGU. TUBAN contains many accommodation places and restaurant/bars. Beach wise, SEGARA BCH goes 700m immediately south of KUTA BEACH – the remaining 2KM to the airport runway could be said to be TUBAN BCH, although individual sections no doubt have local names – eg the section nearing the airport is PANTAI JERMAN.When I first visited there was a whole bunch of individual beaches along the strip – many suffering severe erosion from wet season storms. Abt 20 years ago the authorities put in a series of groynes – concrete breakwalls to protect beaches and encourage the build up of sand. These have been pretty successful, some more than others so that the now continuous beach is far wider in some sections than others. Sand condition varies too – there are some very high end resorts along the beach path which goes almost the full 2km, and these intensively groom the beach out front so that the sand is spotless and often features a row or two of sunlounges for guests. Other areas are backed by lesser resorts, warung/restaurants, some beach stalls, huts for outrigger guys who fish and take surfers out to distant KUTA REEF + AIRPORT LEFTS, and may not be groomed – hence “dirty beach” complaints from reviewers down page.One thing’s for sure – even the nicest sections of this strip tend to be uncrowded.KUTA REEF and  AIRPORT LEFTS reef + the groynes cut the size of any swell so that water is usually relatively calm – in dry season at least.  Sunsets are great.TIPS – if you are not impressed by the condition of the beach closest your accommodation, walk along the beach path to one of the nicer sections.- a walk the full length of the beach path is good value.- wet season sees prevailing onshore winds which dump lotsa rubbish on the beach. Despite groynes, rare storm surges can badly erode beach and beach path. High end hotel guests shouldn’t worry – all have huge grounds, multi-pools – I’m sure many guests seldom use the beach even on nice days (not infrequent most wet seasons).- TUBAN has lotsa accommodation inland.

1077,T_Galleria_by_DFS_Bali,"I and my husband is a local Indonesian and we are likely to visit Duty Free Galleria for windows shopping or even shopping in some occasions. However usually we parked our car in Galleria Mall which is in the same place of the Duty Free area. This time, we decided to park our car at Duty Free car parking as we wanted to explore it as well for the first time. After we parked our car, as a good customer, we politely asked to one of the local people there whether we have to pay for the parking or not. And he said no need to pay as long as our destination should be the Duty Free otherwise, we are not allowed to park our car there. Suddenly, one of their official car park attendence appeared and very rudely asked us whether we wanted to go to Duty Free or to the mall. We said that we wanted to go to Duty Free for sightseeing and the park attendence arrogantly told us to enter the premises at the main lobby which we have to walk quite far from our car park. Well that's ok. After we explored the duty free, we decided to explore the mall as well for couples of minutes. And after we got back, we found that our car tiers at the back right and left side were broke greatly! We realized it just we went out from the premises! We are very frustrated and we even couldn't move until we called for help for the professionals. The professionals said that the 2 car tiers were purposely being depressed by someone which means someone from the duty free premises!Me and my husband extremely can't accept this. We are very sorry if you don't want us to enter the duty free, but is this somekind of joke for treating your client like this? Are you hiring a professional car attendence or instead hiring aggressive civilians in 5 star premises to break their client's car tiers when they don't like it? If we are the local Indonesian is not allowed to visit the duty free galleria, please say it clearly! With this kind of service, no wonder your rating in tripadvisor is quite low.

1102,Petitenget_Temple,"Please Note:  This review is for The Vihara Dharmayana Temple in Kuta.  It’s submitted here because this temple does not have a Tripadvisor site for reviews.  Bonnie, our driver asked if we wanted to stop at this Chinese Buddhist Temple in Kuta en-route to Anika Tailor. We were excited as we missed visiting a Buddhist temple whilst in Lovina.  Buddhism is similar to Hindu Religion and on many levels it connected well with  aspects of our faith and belief, also an opportunity to extend our knowledge and clear our busy minds. The temple dates back to 1876 and is located on JL Blambangan a busy strip of town. Crossing the road was like a ‘tight rope walk’ as we dodged the traffic.  Kuta is well known for it’s chaotic, full on boisterous party scene and beach sunsets, so we were surprised to have stumbled across a bit of peace and serenity at this Buddhist temple. The courtyard has a warm and peaceful feeling displaying goddess statues, menacing dragons wrapped around elaborate pillars. The entrance is dominated in beautiful red and gold with ornate structures, large red lanterns effortlessly swaying in the afternoon breeze. We took off our shoes and stepped inside, observed locals praying and quietly chanting, captivated by swirls of fragrant incense sticks adding to the spiritual atmosphere. We gently tip toed around listening and admiring the intricate interior, leaving us to question many things in life we take for granted.  A sense of peace and calmness lifted our spirits and we appreciated how religion can change one’s thoughts and thinking even momentarily. We wondered at our leisure and it was nice not to be hurried at any point.  Bonnie gave us adequate opportunity for photos and ask local devotees insightful questions, although I guess this would have been in broken English.  The temple is not huge but well maintained, clean and it’s striking architecture gives it that far eastern-style ambience. We enjoyed our stop here and learned religion plays an imperative part in the lives of Balinese people and culture. We left with strong emotions of calmness and a clear mind reflecting how dipping into a spiritual world for a short space of time can alter your mindfulness, we showed our gratitude by leaving a donation.  Yep! we walked away taking only the good, now we were ready to uncover the other crazy side of Kuta!   Tip:  Check opening times prior to visit, be mindful of your attire i.e. no bare arms, no shorts and be generous in leaving a donation.  Terima makasi.

Not any remarkable content inside. Not worth the effort.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 9, 2017"
1141,Petitenget_Temple,Petitenget Temple is in a fine position overlooking the beach. The nearby car park has  plenty of space. It is one of the temples which protect the island from the sea and has a number of smaller temples inside to receive offerings.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 5, 2017"

1144,Petitenget_Temple,"When we went here the temple was very clean and not overcrowded like other temples.  There was a Lewat with some kids outside the temple too for you to pet if you like.  No hard sales, just a ticket to enter.  I believe that there were tour guides to pay but we went without.  Good family visit.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 27, 2017"

1146,Petitenget_Temple,"On one of our early morning walks from our hotel, we found Petitenget Temple. It has a historic background and the guidebooks say that Petitenget forms one of the island’s Dang Kahyangan collection of sea temples that spiritually guard the island’s perimeters, initiated by the legendary Hindu priest Dang Hyang Nirartha on his historical mission from neighbouring island Java in the 16th century.Men and women need to wear a sarong and sash to go in. You can hire them from the checkpoint for the parking area (50,000 INR each). The guards watch the area closely and won't allow you to enter without the correct clothing. Respect their wishes to save your embarrassment and just go with the flow. Inside the Temple grounds is sparse with little to see and it isn't really worth a visit if you are not spiritually inclined. My wife is a Shinto and I am a Christian, but we share an understanding of the spirit world and we are open to outside forces. On entering the temple grounds, our hands started to tingle. We then entered through the northern wall to find a prayer sanctuary and I felt a strong electrical energy passing through my arms into my back. There was a sign saying only to enter for prayer, so I prayed to God for us to keep safe and well. As I left that area, I still felt my hands tingling. I noticed that my wife was crying in front of the main alter at the southern end, and she said she was unable to control her emotions. A women dressed in ceremonial clothes asked if we had any questions, but my wife embraced her and thanked her for allowing us to be there. We gave a donation to the temple of 100,000 INR and it was gratefully received. Our hands remained tingling until we left the Temple grounds. I would say that this type of experience is rare for us and became a highlight for our visit to Bali. Only go in to pray, it can be a historic and highly charged experience, if you are so inclined.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written February 19, 2017"

1148,Petitenget_Temple,I went with a friend to check this temple. Of course bali has so many temples that is hard to know which ones are worth the trip or not. When we arrived we paid for parking and went for a walk around. We asked a few locals where was the temple and had no clue. We then found this nice facade and security people called us and said the entrance was 50.000 rupiah and gave us a sarong. We told them we had our own sarong but insisted. We went inside and we were confused there was nothing to see inside. Compare to other temples that were worth the money. This was just a facade. We went back to security and realised they only took advantage of us. We didn't get a receipt which you are given at any other temple and we were told that the money we paid was for the sarong rental. Ridiculous. We fought for a refund until they gave up and realised they couldn't keep the lie longer. Such a shame some people in this country just want to take advantage of tourist. So if you are visiting bali. Make sure you get a genuine receipt when you pay entrance to the temple.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 27, 2017"
