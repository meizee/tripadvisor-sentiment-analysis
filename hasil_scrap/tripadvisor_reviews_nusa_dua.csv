35,Nusa_Dua_Beach,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian.

However I realised that there were a series of separately named beaches along this stretch with this being the last one! It was about 3.5km walk but worth it.  It is the very extensive beach frontage for a very impressive hotel. The swimming conditions here were better than at the Nusa Dua public beach area and worth the walk. I walked the way down along the sand and by the waters edge which makes for heavy going so it took me about an hour.  Coming back I cheated and used the extensive paved areas in front of each of the hotels.  It didn’t seem to matter so long as you are discrete and look as if you may be staying in the hotels LOL.

179,Mengiat_Beach,"This is a very beautiful beach and not too crowded. The sea can be a bit rough though (as noted by other reviewers) so take care if you are just wanting a gentle paddle. The beach is mostly owned by the grand resorts (e.g. Grand Hyatt) some of which will not let you use their facilities (unless you buy day passes) and others that will allow you to rent sun beds (for about 150,000 IDR). However, we found in the middle of these there is a small area where you can rent a bed in a nice stretch for 50,000 IDR. Look for the staff wearing green t-shirts as they will help you get setup on the sun bed. You can also get food and drinks delivered to your sun bed - it is very easy to do. When paddling with my baby daughter, I found the water clearer and a little gentler to the right of the public beds area - in front of one of the resorts (the Ayodanas is the name I think).If you walk north along the beach (or the path parallel to the beach), you will quickly get to an outcrop with the water blow hole and a nice garden area.

You can drive directly to this beach and car park, if you look for it on the road signs.  The first time I came down this way it seemed that after passing through the entrance barrier, where you are asked where you are going, you then follow the wide boulevards that all seem to terminate at entrances to all the main hotels. How to escape? Simply look for the name of this beach and follow!  The cafe bar is ok, good value drinks and food.  A little bit further on is a beach bar and restaurant which seemed nice with good views of beach and a pool I think you could use, but it was a loud too booming monotonous bass for me that day.

425,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"I booked a bus from Kuta to head here for e arvo for something to do whilst we waited for more family and friends to arrive in Bali. On arrival we had some confusion with what tickets everyone needed as there were different tickets for different things. But I think to just use the slides it was about $12AUD an adult and $7AUD a child and children were classified as 5-11 (I think). There are 3 types of slides a tube one, normal and the bowl type which hurt a bit due the joins in pipes not being flat and it hurt your back when sliding. There is a restaurant there which wasn't too bad I think we got a few baskets of hot chips and most of us had a few drinks which were slightly higher prices then as well but nothing compares to Australian prices. The location was perfect right on the beach overlooking a bay in Nusa Dua and apparently on one side there is a temple and the other side a blow hole. The place had a pool to use and also a kids pool with a cubby house into it. The wave rider is a hit with older children and adults as well. Overall a good place to come for a bit of chill out time for half the day. Just can't take any of your own food and drink in they will take it off you but return when you leave. And pool towels were a cost can't remember now how much but no more then $5. So maybe take your own if you have some.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written May 15, 2017"

433,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"This place is not for kids under about 8. We took our 5 year old here, it was pretty much a waste of money.Firstly they have a sign saying you need to be 140cm or taller to use the waterslides (even though it says it's for kids 5+ ... never seen a 5 year old that tall before..). There are 3 waterslides, the wave riding slope, a small pool for general swimming, and a tiny toddler pool with a piece of toddler play equipment.Our 5 yr old was only able to use the red slide whilst sitting on our laps, the others were too rough and large for her.They have life jackets there to use for free which was good for her. They have one or two staff around the slides keeping an eye on them, though sometimes none at the bottom.Make sure you wear swimming undies and board shorts: the slides are pretty painful with only one layer, & we saw one guy lose his boardies on the wave rider.The slides are a bit rough, not smooth and gentle, and you need to lift your feet as you go down or they get burnt with scraping. The slides seem perfect for approx 8-17yr olds, for adults with more weight they can be a bit painful! There were some pretty brutal slide attempts we observed!The stairs are rusted, but have some grip on them thankfully.The (ladies) toilets were horrible & dirty, nowhere private to change, only one bench near the entrance to put your bag as you change. A male staff member was cleaning in the ladies when we entered :/There are lockers and towels you can hire which is good.Saw plenty of kids having a blast there, and no queues to use slides, but unfortunately our experience wasn't age-appropriate.

434,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"We came here last year after Pirate Bay next door and stayed for most of the day.  You can hire pool towels (large) for $1 ea, they have a pool you can use which was backyard size but enough to cool off in and the kids chose to ride the slides package which was the round space bowl & 2 smaller slides for $7.50ea, we thought this was great value as the adults didnt need to keep going up the top as it wasnt too high buut enough to get their 8-10yr old adrenaline pumping ;)  There is also a wave rider for about $15 for 2hrs, but i would not recommend this to kids under 8yrs unless they have experience in skiing or water ski or surfing as i saw a few MINOR injuries from falling off, including an older man with 2 bleeding head woounds (obviously not a skier lol)  he lol about it and the staff were great with assisting him with first aid.  We ordered the satays same as last time, Calamari rings, cheeseburgers for kids (which got sent back uncooked in the centre of meat), Cocktails, juices & water.  we arrived at 12 and were told the pizza dough was being made and would not be ready for 1hr so we didnt order pizza.  Our meals took over 1hr of going back and forth to waiters to ask where the chips, satays, Calamari and other ordeers were.  People around us were getting there orders and pizza long before our orders.  the upside was they tried to compensate with free drinks (cocktails) werent charge at the end and they had messed up the bills in terms of orders.  The satays chicken was so small i swear they chased a chick to make them in that hour and the sauce was average in taste.  The burgers had red uncooked meat so we had to wait until near dinner to get them back also (slight exaggeration, but seemed so long!)   The calamari was overcooked and my friend asked for fries not potato chips on the side as our other friend got wwith the burger.  Well they brang out the burger and potato crisps 25mins later!  we had to wait for the hot chips after that (so grumpy whingy kids at this point - lucky the cocktails were free i was almost chuggn them down :)  There is a fantastic view of the beach and lounges with cushions on the lawn area opposite the beach.  The restaurant has both upstairs & downstairs dining and only dozen chairs or lounges around the ppool and ony half with umbrellas!  Unfortunately our group 8 had to share 1 umbrella zone (i opted to turn my milk skin into cuppacino waiting for the food to arrive) and so the kids & friends i introduced to Surf & Turf could get some shade waiting for food.

We ended up  going there most days for an hour or two to break up the day/ have lunch / dinner  etc as my two sons 11 and 13 couldn't get enough of the simulated surf rider and water slides. Really good value at about $7/ hour for surfing or $15 for an all day slide package including 2hours of surfing. Many times we went there, the boys had the slides/surf rider to themselves or there was only a couple of other kids which was magic and a great way for them to burn off energy as Nusa Dua can be pretty quiet. The food was about a third of the price of our hotel and the menu was good, standard fare - burgers, sate chicken, pizza, noodles, etc. The pool deck had lots of sun lounges and overlooked the ocean.

Check in was smooth, fast and informative then we were whisked away in a buggy to our lovely room.We were so pleasantly surprised to wake to the stunning ocean view from our room.

479,The_Bay_Bali,"Guys, I took the family to Bali bay today. The good: It had some nice places to shop, cheap beer, cheap/good food. Fun and friendly atmosphere.The BAD: The cleanliness of the area was disgusting! Trash all over the beachs, trash all in the water. I observed several kids coming out of the water with plastic trash in their hair. I have been blessed to have the opportunity to visit many places around the world. I am partial to the ocean so always end up there. I would not even compare the Bali Bay beach to that of the Gulf of Mexico where I am from many years ago. If you are in the US, go to Padre Island or Myrtle beach it's cheaper and a better/cleaner beach and better value. If you're in Europe, pick almost any beach and it will be cleaner than this. I am very disappointed with Indonesia in general for letting this happen over the years. It's terrible, swimming with trash, even in front of the biggest hotels/resorts they don't seem to bother with trash pickup. If you find this a nice beach, you need to get out!

We arrived on our 3rd visit and there were another 2 adults wanting to go on, but they were closing in 30 mins ( not that this was advertised) but still wanted the full price for a 2 hour session!??!!?This place is asking to be closed down and I'm sure it's only a matter of time until it is.  Not only does it look derelict but it's very rundown and dangerous looking.....there are no staff around, no lights on around the bar and restaurant area, no music being played and all the chair and sunbed cushions are stacked away.  I wished I'd taken photos to show the shabbiest of it all.  It was probably a good omen my son was able to surf here as I'm sure the surf rider is unsafe and unmaintained.

The boys had fun on the slides that were open, and yes things are in need of repair but they still had fun and it seemed safe enough.

On the bad side it did concern me greatly about the rusted condition of the structure of the frame for the stairs and the slide as a whole,  the hand rails were loose in areas and the stair treads had been covered over with aluminium plate in many areas.  I would be fearful of this place in 6 months but after a thorough check i was happy for the kids to use it in July 2018.....it is after all Bali and not Australia.   The surf ride was brilliant and my kids loved it, they even let my little one jump in the water jet to ride up the wave hill......as i mentioned the staff were great.

639,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"I booked a bus from Kuta to head here for e arvo for something to do whilst we waited for more family and friends to arrive in Bali. On arrival we had some confusion with what tickets everyone needed as there were different tickets for different things. But I think to just use the slides it was about $12AUD an adult and $7AUD a child and children were classified as 5-11 (I think). There are 3 types of slides a tube one, normal and the bowl type which hurt a bit due the joins in pipes not being flat and it hurt your back when sliding. There is a restaurant there which wasn't too bad I think we got a few baskets of hot chips and most of us had a few drinks which were slightly higher prices then as well but nothing compares to Australian prices. The location was perfect right on the beach overlooking a bay in Nusa Dua and apparently on one side there is a temple and the other side a blow hole. The place had a pool to use and also a kids pool with a cubby house into it. The wave rider is a hit with older children and adults as well. Overall a good place to come for a bit of chill out time for half the day. Just can't take any of your own food and drink in they will take it off you but return when you leave.

Its a great place to either swim in the ocean or pool and the kids have waterslides to go down.

647,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"This place is not for kids under about 8. We took our 5 year old here, it was pretty much a waste of money.Firstly they have a sign saying you need to be 140cm or taller to use the waterslides (even though it says it's for kids 5+ ... never seen a 5 year old that tall before..). There are 3 waterslides, the wave riding slope, a small pool for general swimming, and a tiny toddler pool with a piece of toddler play equipment.Our 5 yr old was only able to use the red slide whilst sitting on our laps, the others were too rough and large for her.They have life jackets there to use for free which was good for her. They have one or two staff around the slides keeping an eye on them, though sometimes none at the bottom.Make sure you wear swimming undies and board shorts: the slides are pretty painful with only one layer, & we saw one guy lose his boardies on the wave rider.The slides are a bit rough, not smooth and gentle, and you need to lift your feet as you go down or they get burnt with scraping. The slides seem perfect for approx 8-17yr olds, for adults with more weight they can be a bit painful! There were some pretty brutal slide attempts we observed!The stairs are rusted, but have some grip on them thankfully.The (ladies) toilets were horrible & dirty, nowhere private to change, only one bench near the entrance to put your bag as you change. A male staff member was cleaning in the ladies when we entered :/There are lockers and towels you can hire which is good.Saw plenty of kids having a blast there, and no queues to use slides, but unfortunately our experience wasn't age-appropriate.

648,Surf_Turf_Nusa_Dua,"We came here last year after Pirate Bay next door and stayed for most of the day.  You can hire pool towels (large) for $1 ea, they have a pool you can use which was backyard size but enough to cool off in and the kids chose to ride the slides package which was the round space bowl & 2 smaller slides for $7.50ea, we thought this was great value as the adults didnt need to keep going up the top as it wasnt too high buut enough to get their 8-10yr old adrenaline pumping ;)  There is also a wave rider for about $15 for 2hrs, but i would not recommend this to kids under 8yrs unless they have experience in skiing or water ski or surfing as i saw a few MINOR injuries from falling off, including an older man with 2 bleeding head woounds (obviously not a skier lol)  he lol about it and the staff were great with assisting him with first aid.  We ordered the satays same as last time, Calamari rings, cheeseburgers for kids (which got sent back uncooked in the centre of meat), Cocktails, juices & water.  we arrived at 12 and were told the pizza dough was being made and would not be ready for 1hr so we didnt order pizza.  Our meals took over 1hr of going back and forth to waiters to ask where the chips, satays, Calamari and other ordeers were.  People around us were getting there orders and pizza long before our orders.  the upside was they tried to compensate with free drinks (cocktails) werent charge at the end and they had messed up the bills in terms of orders.  The satays chicken was so small i swear they chased a chick to make them in that hour and the sauce was average in taste.  The burgers had red uncooked meat so we had to wait until near dinner to get them back also (slight exaggeration, but seemed so long!)   The calamari was overcooked and my friend asked for fries not potato chips on the side as our other friend got wwith the burger.  Well they brang out the burger and potato crisps 25mins later!  we had to wait for the hot chips after that (so grumpy whingy kids at this point - lucky the cocktails were free i was almost chuggn them down :)  There is a fantastic view of the beach and lounges with cushions on the lawn area opposite the beach.  The restaurant has both upstairs & downstairs dining and only dozen chairs or lounges around the ppool and ony half with umbrellas!  Unfortunately our group 8 had to share 1 umbrella zone (i opted to turn my milk skin into cuppacino waiting for the food to arrive) and so the kids & friends i introduced to Surf & Turf could get some shade waiting for food.

We ended up  going there most days for an hour or two to break up the day/ have lunch / dinner  etc as my two sons 11 and 13 couldn't get enough of the simulated surf rider and water slides. Really good value at about $7/ hour for surfing or $15 for an all day slide package including 2hours of surfing. Many times we went there, the boys had the slides/surf rider to themselves or there was only a couple of other kids which was magic and a great way for them to burn off energy as Nusa Dua can be pretty quiet. The food was about a third of the price of our hotel and the menu was good, standard fare - burgers, sate chicken, pizza, noodles, etc. The pool deck had lots of sun lounges and overlooked the ocean.

When we arrived we were promptly welcomed by the lovely staff, layed and offered a nice cold coconut drink and peppermint refreshment towel.  Check in was smooth, fast and informative then we were whisked away in a buggy to our lovely room.We were so pleasantly surprised to wake to the stunning ocean view from our room.

There is a lounge and dining room, two bathrooms and a huge bedroom with two queen beds and a single bed.The beds are very comfortable, the bath tub is huge and the shower is devine. There are two TV's in separate rooms which is great when you have kids. There are lots of channels and YES they do have Setanta which plays all of the rugby league games live!

The other restaurant offers a great selection of western, asian and seafood. Everything we've ordered has been exceptional.There is a kids club from 9:00am to 5:00pm everyday which offers various activities for the children to enjoy.

693,The_Bay_Bali,"Guys, I took the family to Bali bay today. The good: It had some nice places to shop, cheap beer, cheap/good food. Fun and friendly atmosphere.The BAD: The cleanliness of the area was disgusting! Trash all over the beachs, trash all in the water. I observed several kids coming out of the water with plastic trash in their hair. I have been blessed to have the opportunity to visit many places around the world. I am partial to the ocean so always end up there. I would not even compare the Bali Bay beach to that of the Gulf of Mexico where I am from many years ago. If you are in the US, go to Padre Island or Myrtle beach it's cheaper and a better/cleaner beach and better value. If you're in Europe, pick almost any beach and it will be cleaner than this. I am very disappointed with Indonesia in general for letting this happen over the years. It's terrible, swimming with trash, even in front of the biggest hotels/resorts they don't seem to bother with trash pickup. If you find this a nice beach, you need to get out!

Feels like you have stepped into a fancy day spa in the states or any western country.All the staff are super friendly and for the most part speak excellent english.  Their range of services is vast and extensive for both men and women.  They have designed it to have a traditional men's barbershop on one side of the building and a fancier ladies salon on the other side of the building.Check out their website for a glimpse of their offerings.  If you don't see a service you are looking for, simply call or whattsapp them to ask if they can perform whatever you desire and chances are they will be able to arrange it.I go regularly for a mens' clip and cut.  If you connect with a specific barber, find out his work schedule and make a request for him when you book an appointment.  Speaking of appointments, I highly suggest calling ahead to do so, as on the weekends and even weekdays they can sometimes be empty and other days be slammed.The mens haricut rocks.  Starts out with a fantastic head massage/hariwash, followed by the cut of your choosing.  There is a huge board with suggested styles (all with a specific number to order by) you can check out while getting your wash.  Then afterwards order your haircut by number off of the board, or simply tell the barber if something specific and let them do the rest.  After your cut, back to the shampoo station you go to wash out all the short clipped hair and another scalp massage.  Finally back to the chair for any final touch ups, a fantastic neck/shoulder massage and style.  You would easily pay over $50+ UDS in a major city for a haircut experience like this.  At the Shampoo Lounge  it will be just a fraction of that price.  They are constantly offering special deals so call ahead and plan your visit accordingly.The Manager (Christina) is a gem.  She runs the place as if it is her personal mission to make every guest feel right at home.  Tell her Nathan sent you and she will take great care of you!And the best part of your Shampoo Lounge experience is the if you have worked up an appetite during your treatment, there is an amazing Mexican restaurant (Taqisa) just a short five minute walk to the south of the salon.  Best Baja Mexican food on the island.  Think Street tacos, Burritos with tender pulled meats and fresh salsa made daily.

937,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"We were staying in a fancy hotel in the area, but thought the spa prices were too expensive. This spa was very close to our hotel, and we went here three times. Great massages! All the (little older) ladies were super! Really great. We had a traditional bali massage and a deep tissue one and a foot reflex massage. All really great. Prices are much better here and absolutely worth it. Wifi in the building. There are a view options in the street that are a little cheaper but ths one was very nice.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written August 26, 2019"

963,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"Came to this place because of good recent reviews in tripadvisor. I did not expect anything fancy, just wanted to have a good massage to unwind; but it turned out to be a waste of time. The therapist assigned was lack of training, most of the times did a random massage, no pressure applied even after telling her about it. She basically rubbed the massage oil all over the body with no purpose. Appreciate the discount given after telling the front staff about my bad experience. They really need to pay more attention to the service offered in order to maintain the performance.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written January 5, 2019"

965,Bali_Refresh_Spa,Our family of six each had two hour massages yesterday.  They were very good and would definately recommend them if you are here.  We liked it so much that we went back today for another two hour massage. The massages are very good and very reasonable. If you are looking for luxury surroundings stick to massages in your hotel at a much higher cost but if you want a very good massage for a very reasonable price come here.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Written December 28, 2018"
