Service is wonderful, food is surprisingly nice overall too. The entrance tickets may seem a bit pricey but I’d say it is worth a whole day at the pool, plus they have lots of promotions going on. Hopefully they can survive this pandemic. Will come back soon with my kids!",5,2021-12-05
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"We had a awesome day in Waterbom park. First, they give you a wrist band that you can charge and buy food, drinks, etc. in the park. If your wrist band is still charged when you leave. The rest of the money will be returned to you. It is a large water park with high water slides. One of the best parts is the lazy river that sleeps on the tube and the flow of water moves you in a green direction. There are a number of cafes and fast foods there. We used massage there, they were not professional but it is good for the park. Spend a full day at Waterbom,  it 's a lot of fun.",5,2021-09-18

And also in Waterbom Bali, There are people who is a guards that will watch over us and reprimand us if we commit violations such as eating food while swimming or drinking while swimming.Also if you went to Waterbom Bali, I suggest you to look at the map and remember the rute because I once had lost and get separeted with my cousins inside of Waterbom Bali.

You have a bit for everyone. you can come spend the whole day there with family or group of friend or both.The staff is so amazing, keeping everyone safe with a smile and always friendly things to say. I had no issue going for a coconut poolside while my teen was running around the park trying every ride. She came back and told me she now knew all the staff and had had friendly chit chat with each. She then decided to introduce me. Anyway, it was just her and me for a bounding time. We had the most amazing day. And the fact that it was discounted because of covid made it even better",5,2021-04-16

kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"As we were unable to attend Waterbom Park due to not being able to enter the country I attempted to contact Waterbom Park to see if they would refund or credit the $450 I paid for my family and a shelter for the day.    I received no communication back until they asked me how I enjoyed my time at Waterbom Park and asked me to fill out a survey.Very poor form Waterbom, is that classed as salt into the wound?",1,2020-05-13
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"Its been many years since a visit to Waterbom in Bali - what a transformation! Super impressed with the whole experience - booked online, with meals and towels included in the package.

Way better than I remembered or expected - well done Waterbom - we'll be back.",5,2020-03-17
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"We visited here on our honeymoon, it was a really fun day, there's lots to do and we really enjoyed the Lazy River and Pool Bar,  would highly recommend, there is a kids pool which was separate from the main pool which meant it was a bit quieter by the main pool which had chilled music playing all day. We purchased the tickets online in advance which were slightly cheaper.",5,2020-03-14

kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"Awesome water park with so much varietyof slides and pools, food was excellent and price was really good.",5,2020-03-14
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"My partner and I had the BEST time at Waterbom yesterday. The entire park is immaculately clean, hygienic and organized to a tee! The food was so great and well priced - I really appreciate how environmentally friendly it was too - the food served on banana leaves (including the little dipping sauces). The smoothie I had was the best I’ve ever had anywhere! The slides were so much fun. And safe!! The staff were all so attentive and friendly and professional. Amazing. The showers and toilets were so clean and nothing like other public pools I’ve been to anywhere in the world. The lazy river was so awesome and relaxing. I don’t have kids but I could see so many great rides and pools for the kids to enjoy! I could not speak more highly of the experience we had. People should not complain about the entrance fee and costs of food and drink etc. (my amazing hot dog chips and onion rings was 85k - it’s cheap!!) We pay a LOT more in Australia for our water theme parks and this one is just as if not more deserving to warrant the entrance fee it charges. It’s a bargain in my opinion!! Especially if you pay online before you go. We are so lucky as tourists to have the Balinese people provide us with places like this one. They truly are beautiful, hospitable people. Thank you very much. Ps - it would be nice if people would refrain from smoking cigarettes whilst there - seeing as there are kids around. They wouldn’t get away with it in Australia so it sucks that they think it’s ok to do it here. There definitely are certain groups of Australians that give us a bad name in Bali. I’ll leave it there ...",5,2020-03-13
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"A must do if you are visiting Bali, great fun , and value for money, very clean and beautiful surroundings",5,2020-03-13
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"There weren’t many slides that my 4yo could do with an adult, she did enjoy the kiddie slides though and was able to go on one big slide, the one with the big yellow tube thing. We all enjoyed the lazy river. The kids water playground was great",4,2020-03-13
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"Booked online 6 weeks ago in Australia to visit Waterbom Park in Bali, we use to take the Kids there many years ago.... well my wife and I who recently celebrated of 36 year of marriage decide we would go there and hire a cabana for a measly $30 + entrance fee. What a day doing the slides, casual floating on a tide around the park, having lunch brought to you with a Bintang. The staff are great and very helpful, would recommend to everyone, it gets better every time you go there.",5,2020-03-12
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,Overall a great day out. Drinks are expensive for tourists (even for an amusement park) so don't plan on a boozy water park fun time.Rides are good fun and lines move steadily.Not much for extreme thrills but enough to keep it interesting and convince the less adventurous to have a go.,5,2020-03-12
kuta,Waterbom_Bali,"Was cool trip to water boom. But, it was too expensive for the entrance ticket especially for local! If water boom can give friendly price for the entrance I think will be even more people visit  especially local.",3,2020-03-11

kuta,Pandawa_Beach,"Pandawa beach is one of my favorite renowned white sand beaches in southern bali.The local community is more familiar with the name Kutuh beach. You need to pay an entrance fee. You will pass a road flanked by steep rocky cliffs. You could see a status of Panca Pandawa taken from the Mahabrata story. Therefore the beach is called Pandawa Beach Bali.From the top fo the cliff, you will see an amazing the Indian ocean view. Pandawa beach is very famous as one of the secret beaches in bali among foreign visitors around year 2000 and it was considered Bali's secret coast. Since the year 2012, I could say Pandawa beach is wide open to more public and no longer one of blai hidden beaches, but still it is a lovely beach with an amazing ocean view.Over all, Pandawa beach offers a tremendous ocean view.

When you arrive at Pandawa Beach you need to pay access and it it 15.000 Rp each person its 0.80 cents Euro.. When you arrive down at the beach you have many beach clubs. We went to the Roosterfish that I really recommend for his good food and good service.The sea is here beautiful and the view is also amazing.",4,2020-03-21

kuta,Pandawa_Beach,"I visited this place twice, 1st time was in 2017, my 2nd time was just recently in Feb 2020. Back in 2017,  i was told that this beach is just open to public 1 year ago (2016). It was breathtaking, the colours of the ocean were spectacular. In 2020 I decided to come back again, it was already crowded (despite of the reduced numbers of visitors due to Coronavirus) and more tourist facilities are erected. I was just a bit disappointed of how the waters are not as clear as before (not sure is it because of the season or mass-tourism effect). But I enjoyed the water activity here i.e kayaking. This beach is also wayyy better than Nusa Dua.",4,2020-03-02

kuta,Pandawa_Beach,"This beach is located at the base of a former massive limestone quarry which you have to pay to get into RP65,000 (two adults and parking). The beach is nice enough and if you wander past the many warungs it even gets quiet. Overall it is now an inflated tourist trap including a Hollywood style sign in the hills. But for us, as geologists, it was quite a cool setting.",3,2020-01-12

kuta,Pandawa_Beach,"I read reviews of this beach and the words used to describe it was “pristine”, “gem of a place” etc. you get the picture. Hence we were excited to go visit this beach. Lo and behold the absolute disappointment the moment we hit the shores (had to walk past the rows of establishments sprung up to capture the tourist dollar). Beach was dirty, overcrowded and had a lack of public amenities (I don’t count those toilets set up by commercial establishments and which are also dirty as public amenities). The water was also not clear so I’m really unsure how adjectives such as pristine could be used to describe it.",1,2020-01-10
kuta,Pandawa_Beach,"The food are all small stalls and looked a bit unkempt. But I appreciate the similar looks and price, like all the stalls offering almost the same stuffs with the exactly same price, for example french fries, 25,000 ids (1,5 usd approx) etc. No place to have decent showers, only places that looked a bit dirty so I washed my children feet and hands at the free shower poles. Also no place to hide under the suns, no coconut trees, if want to hide from the sun have to buy drinks at the food stall. The sand is clean. My children liked to play there at 12-13 at noon. Very hot but very happy... for them playing sand",4,2020-01-03
kuta,Beachwalk_Shopping_Center,"In my opinion, Beach Walk is the best shopping center in Bali. It has a very beautiful architecture.

kuta,Beachwalk_Shopping_Center,"We stayed in Bali for 10 months and this mall in my opinion, has the best variety of stores in Bali. Bali is limited for high street style stores that were were used to in the UK. But Beachwalk has Zara, H&M, Pull & Bear, Berskha, Victoria Secret, Body Shop, plus sport shops, jewellery shops etc. It’s also surrounded by local shops, restaurants and the beach is right opposite.

Popular among teens and families.  Not what I seek out when traveling abroad but it is clean and certainly a nice shopping mall.",4,2020-04-30
kuta,Beachwalk_Shopping_Center,"It is the one and only shopping mall in Kuta area that will give you a flashback of the typical malls you will find in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Melbourne, Tokyo, etc. There is an abundance of western-asian fusion restaurants, cafes and bars. Familiar brands like Mango, H&M, Zara, Fossil, L'Occitane, MAC, Michael Kors are available. They have limited shops that sell local souvenirs and produce, so best to save that for when you visit other areas of Bali (eg: Ubud).It's located just a road away from Kuta Beach and the Sheraton Kuta Bali Resort.",4,2020-04-14

kuta,Beachwalk_Shopping_Center,"I enjoyed the visit to Beachwalk Shopping Mall. The best bit of course it's the sales plus aircon. If you find that to bargain in the street in the heat is too much then Beachwalk Shopping Mall could be the place to go. The one thing I did not like was there were people trying to sell time share to us just near the entrance to the mall where we had our bags checked by security. They were very very persistent. One man even said to us they were genuine, ask the security guard, we had won prizes. The security guard turned and said to us,'Yea, Congrats.'It was quite incredible. Come to think of it, I am not impressed with the security guard's behaviour. This Mall is really for tourists and you pay accordingly. But you can get bargains when the sales are on and find what you like.",4,2020-03-02

We went to Johnny Rockets for lunch mainly because were were very hungry and it was the first food place we spied.  Later we found the top floor had a food court with lots of small stands with good prices and several restaurants with good views.  There were also some well priced souvenir stores on the top floor if you don't feel like haggling at the markets.  Great views were to be had from the outdoor areas.

On the bottom floor there is a good supermarket with a money change counter at the front of the shop.  There is also a book shop in this centre however it has more kids stuff than books.TAXISCatching a blue bird taxi home at night is disastrous and very hard to do as they are mostly the other taxi companies that look like a rip off blue bird service that are always hovering and wanting a fixed price that can be 3 times the amount of a bluebird taxi who put the meter on and are far more pleasant to travel with.  We always wait for bluebird as we’ve found a lot of the other taxi drivers rude and aggressive.  So never again.  Look for the sign on top of the bluebird windscreens that say Bluebird group or something like that, they are the real bluebird drivers.  We waited an hour plus for a bluebird taxi at night",4,2020-01-22

kuta,Bali_Sea_Turtle_Society_BSTS,So disappointed but I suppose it can’t be helped...!! I spent quite a while researching the different places to go and see turtles while staying in Bali. After reading reviews on Turtle Island and Turtle Conservation in Seregan we chose to visit BSTS. We were dropped at the entrance to Kuta beach and walked along and couldn’t see anything... we asked a local information desk to help and he told us we’d see a giant turtle. On waking back we saw a giant turtle and building covered in tarpaulin. We looked around for a good 10 minutes to find someone to help us but no one was there at all (even though doors were open) we then asked a gentleman sitting on a chair out the front who’s response was no turtles... we only took that to mean it was closed so we left. I’d looked online and on their FB page and there were updates and images so all looks very professional. On arrival is very dingy and looks a little bit of a mess. They have recently updated their FB to say they do not have any turtles to release for a while... this would have been updated earlier as we traveled to the area to see them. With a place like this communication on online fronts need to be at its best so people are aware of what’s going on and when. Traffic and donations may then be higher...,2,2020-01-14

It is also a bustling commercial and social hub, for both international tourists, as well as the local Balinese people.

kuta,Kuta_Beach_Bali,"You should go there because: - When in Bali, one must do the touristy thing of visiting Kuta BeachYou should leave immediately because:- All the beach vendors know you are a tourist and will swarm up on you to get you to buy whatever it is they are well- Even after you politely decline, another herd of beach vendors will march towards you and ask you the same thing.- The third round of beach vendors will leave you annoyed because they will try to catch your attention by saying things like ""hey pretty girl"" or ""ni hao, nayoung, konichiwa, what language do you speak?""- The sand is dirty with all sorts of rubbish- You'd probably not want to look at people drinking beer as early as 9am in the morning and shouted each other.

kuta,Balangan_Beach,"Pantai Balangan, situated on the western part of South Bali. You can reach this place by car, they have public parking spaces. Apparently there are 2 parking spaces, one on the cliff, the other one is near the beach. The one on the cliff has a magnificent view to the ocean. You can access the beach by going down the stairs. Once at the beach you can rent beach chairs and order drinks. We had a great time at the beach as there were  not too many people around and also NO street vendors. During the rainy season, a lot of debris (wood) and rubbish will wash ashore which can make the experience less fun. Please keep in mind that this is a public beach where locals are trying their best to keep the beach clean without any funding from the government. Please beware of monkeys as this arra is still considered a “wild” habitat so those wooden debris that wash ashore will come in handy to scare them away.

This trip I actually went, and was beyond saddened to see it could easily be mistaken as a theme park entrance at night.

What I am personally unsure about is the way the memorial is lit up at night, bright strobing colours made it look more like an amusement park than a memorial.

So I can not pay upfront, but only two days later. The guy at the reception told me that I can't start training without paying the whole price upfront, so I either need to wait or pay for the two days extra, which would make it 500.000 rupiah more expensive. So silly, as if I would run away after two days of training. I even offered to pay part of the price upfront.. This comment is not about the training though, since they didn't let me in, as I said above.",2,2020-03-04

But let’s be honest not much else. There’s a few surf shops but no one entered them and also a couple of convenience stores to stock up your bing tang. There are also street hawkers there trying to give you scratchiest yo win a prize but we all know it ends up being a time share seminar and you never get the prize you win.

We were not approached by any other sales person during any of our visits. My wife purchased some lovely clothing for the grandkids, excellent quality and at a fraction of prices at home. Still the same problem for myself, I just can't squeeze into a 2XL, no big men's section here.

kuta,Matahari_Kuta_Square,"You get bombared by the perfume people when you walk into the store, then have trouble finding anyone to help you there after. They had plenty of sales on due to low customers I gather but it was very hard to get assistence, which I find odd in Bali. Also we had to use the bathroom facitllies while shopping and they were run down, filthy and with no provisions to use except water that barely turned on, then hard to turn off. It was appalling.",3,2020-03-01
kuta,Matahari_Kuta_Square,"I love Mata Hari at Kuta Square. It invites you to enter the shopping mindset of the domestic tourist. Prices are so reasonable, luckily, because there is no bargaining here. All fixed prices. The way you pay for your selections, the way they are wrapped, all of this is different to the western way. No speed shopping here. There is everything you need, all under one roof. The iconic department store. You begin by parking underneath. Then you emerge up the stairs with the modest, but more that adequate supermarket to the left, and souvenirs to the right. If it was local fashion that you have come for, or rather nice locally made footwear, then you go to the first level. You wont believe the prices. You will probably buy heaps of things you will ever wear because the prices are minuscule. Getting things paid for and packaged is another story. No one is in a hurry here and please insert some extra steps into the process. If you keep going up you will find toys, mainly and some sporting goods. The trick to succeeding at this style of shopping is to collect everything you think you want to purchase in one hit and then do the paying and wrapping thing. If you to and fro you will become exhausted and annoyed. Now the thing is to put it all in your car and go next door for a refreshing mango juice and coffee.",4,2020-02-20
kuta,Matahari_Kuta_Square,Matahari is a perfect combination of every choices. They have deals in so look out for buy 2 get 1 options. Price range is average & fixed so u do not have to worry about that. I highly recommend matahari apart from other local stores.,5,2020-02-08
kuta,Matahari_Kuta_Square,"This review is a collection of thoughts about the whole Matahari complex, not just the department store. If you are in Kuta, this entire “complex” of shops and services are located in the midst of a gang of surf shops, clothes, some fast food, on a one-way street heading north to Legian.Shops and services that are useful to us;Central Kuta money exchange - just outside the entrance to the main department storeA great food store on the ground floor - has great fruits, and all of your groceries and other needs such as mozzie repellent, shampoo and conditioner, etc etcMobile Sim card - located just outside the food store. No fuss sim cards.A Shine shop with girlie and kids stuff like hair bits and cute bags etc. Good for supply of hair ties etcRight next door to Shine is a DVD shop. Nothing special, its just all together in the same spot as all of the above!Matahari department store is sort of ok. Not good for teens or tweenies, but for really young kids, toddlers etc there is an enormous collection of clothes, shoes etc etc. Good also for emergency toilet access!Fast food joints like Yoshinara, Gloria Jeans, A&W, KFC, pizza, all around here in one easy locationFipper thongsA few surf shops, actually all the brands are represented here in the same surrounds (not necessarily in the Matahari building)Nearby to the main Kuta beach front, and the Kuta Art Markets if bargaining is your thingThen onward to Beach Walk toward Legian, or back south on Jalan Kartika Plaza for the gauntlett of other restaurants, shopping, and massage etc. We do the fixed price shops like Rika, Jenny, Dianne shops (all of these on Kartika Plaza) so that we avoid the bargaining thing.A bit of everything that you might need....",3,2020-01-19

The Boatmen were very supportive which made the boat-trip convenient.  Timing wise: From Sanur to Padang bay took an hour. From Padang bay to Canngu, 1 hour and twenty minutes.

After finalising our bookings, and finally arrived to Bali we found out the hard way that the services booked were not actually quite accurate...We had shuttles booked at some of our trips (we had 3 boat rides altogether) and only the first pick-up was according plan. The boat was never direct boat (as per the information online), we were always stopped and had to transfer to another boat... On our last boat ride back to Bali we waited about 4,5 hours for a boat to take us from the island, because the agency forgot to add us to the morning boat, so there was no place left... and we had to take an afternoon one, which arrived evening.... then upon arriving to Bali, they wanted to cram us into big buses of 30 people to be driven to our final destinations... our hotel being one of the last on the list... So after spending a whole day waiting, then 3 hours on the boat (instead of 1h), they wanted us to take 4,5hours on the bus to the hotel... no way. super horrible experience, no professional attitude and surely a ripoff... would never recommend.",1,2020-03-19

The market opens right after the break of dawn, and the bustling scene continues throughout the day, with countless pick-up trucks with boxes ready to ship out their fresh seafood to hotels and restaurants, while local fishing boats land and unload their catches, greeted by smaller vendors on the sand. Over all, kedonganan fish market is a good place to buy fresh seafood with an affordable price. Enjoy",5,2021-09-01

The excitement, so many choices, and eventually four purchased. Next morning another visit, another dress and a handbag; happy seller and happy customer.  All five dresses were good quality and excellent beachwear. Judging by the reaction back home, it looks as if another visit will be scheduled if visiting again.",4,2020-03-25

kuta,Petitenget_Temple,"Please Note:  This review is for The Vihara Dharmayana Temple in Kuta.  It’s submitted here because this temple does not have a Tripadvisor site for reviews.  Bonnie, our driver asked if we wanted to stop at this Chinese Buddhist Temple in Kuta en-route to Anika Tailor. We were excited as we missed visiting a Buddhist temple whilst in Lovina.  Buddhism is similar to Hindu Religion and on many levels it connected well with  aspects of our faith and belief, also an opportunity to extend our knowledge and clear our busy minds. The temple dates back to 1876 and is located on JL Blambangan a busy strip of town. Crossing the road was like a ‘tight rope walk’ as we dodged the traffic.  Kuta is well known for it’s chaotic, full on boisterous party scene and beach sunsets, so we were surprised to have stumbled across a bit of peace and serenity at this Buddhist temple. The courtyard has a warm and peaceful feeling displaying goddess statues, menacing dragons wrapped around elaborate pillars. The entrance is dominated in beautiful red and gold with ornate structures, large red lanterns effortlessly swaying in the afternoon breeze. We took off our shoes and stepped inside, observed locals praying and quietly chanting, captivated by swirls of fragrant incense sticks adding to the spiritual atmosphere. We gently tip toed around listening and admiring the intricate interior, leaving us to question many things in life we take for granted.  A sense of peace and calmness lifted our spirits and we appreciated how religion can change one’s thoughts and thinking even momentarily. We wondered at our leisure and it was nice not to be hurried at any point.  Bonnie gave us adequate opportunity for photos and ask local devotees insightful questions, although I guess this would have been in broken English.  The temple is not huge but well maintained, clean and it’s striking architecture gives it that far eastern-style ambience. We enjoyed our stop here and learned religion plays an imperative part in the lives of Balinese people and culture. We left with strong emotions of calmness and a clear mind reflecting how dipping into a spiritual world for a short space of time can alter your mindfulness, we showed our gratitude by leaving a donation.  Yep! we walked away taking only the good, now we were ready to uncover the other crazy side of Kuta!   Tip:  Check opening times prior to visit, be mindful of your attire i.e. no bare arms, no shorts and be generous in leaving a donation.  Terima makasi. Indu & Versha.",5,2020-07-31
sanur,Sindhu_Market,"We love to eat at food courts and night markets and this one did not disappoint. Approximately 15 different stalls serving a variety of foods. Started with chicken satay sticks which were very tasty. A little on the small side, but at only $1.50 for 10 sticks how can you go wrong. Usual Nasi Goreng and Mie Goreng for under $3 but our new favourite meal is Tami Goreng which is mixed veges and chicken over fried noodles. We went three out of the 6 nights we were in Sanur and because my husband had left something behind at the hotel we also came back to the area after a day trip to Ubud and went to the market again. Also recommend the banana fritters, especially if they are freshly cooked.",4,2020-03-18
sanur,Sindhu_Market,"This is a small night market where you can buy freshly made and cooked foods such as nasi campur, nasi goreng, delicious home made Indonesian sweet foods, chicken, curry, dumplings and much more.

Satay chicken was yummy but a 40 minute wait to order and we  were the 1st in line, all the locals get fed 1st they don’t wait in line and they just keep turning up. There was also very little chicken on each skewer, 10 skewers per serve for $1.50.We also went to the fried food stall with spring rolls fried banana, fried beans donuts etc got 17pieces for $1.70 an absolute bargain and also all delicious, especially the fried coconut donut...omg. I also got the fresh juice of banana and dragon, also absolutely delicious . All up dinner cost for both of us $8.80 which included all the above plus a Bintang.My husband and I both left feeling so full. Simple no fuss and delicious.

Will for sure eat there again.,5,2020-02-06

sanur,Sindhu_Market,We go here often and still the best value in Sanur for more authentic food. Don't be afraid to eat at this market. The local cuisine here is awesome and cheap. We often go to Ihu du seafood down the back right hand corner. You pick your fish or seafood and the ladies take it down to the gent who I reckon is the Bali master of open grill. Never have I had a crappy prawn and my better half goes the local snapper every time. The ladies do great veggies and rice and will even go and get you a bintang.

And it was so much trash coming in from the ocean that it was a little bit disgusting to bathe.

The only bugbear can occasionally be the risk of being run over by a cyclist!  It is very quiet, traffic free,apart from the bikes and it's easy to find a quiet spot under a tree with a book.

sanur,Sanur_Beach,"We were impressed with Sanur beach. Much nicer than Legian, Kuta. Clean beach with few waves. Great for children. And you don’t get harassed by 10 people selling you things. It’s quiet and we will be back to Sanur for sure",5,2020-02-17
sanur,Sanur_Beach,Traveled to bali with a friend who is a bali seasoned traveler. We stayed at swastika guesthouse for under $300 aus a week. Spend most of our time at sand bar. We went to kuta for a day trip and couldn't wait to get out of there and get back to sanur,5,2020-02-14

sanur,Sanur_Beach,"Nice beach, lots of opportunities for food and service, observe your surroundings closely. Hmmm. Parts of the beach are more Indonesian, and some parts are more touristy. We enjoyed our visit and felt very safe as we walked, stopped, enjoyed a libation, and walked!",3,2020-02-03
sanur,Sanur_Beach,"My husband and I experienced two ends of the beach as we stayed in two locations.  There is a long walkway all along the beach from the end where the markets are to the quieter end.  This can be walked, run or cycled and is a joy.  There are street vendors but they will only ask you once and leave you alone.  Looking out to the calm  sea full of local boats and listening to the whisper of the waves against the shore.  What is not to love.",5,2020-02-02
sanur,Sanur_Beach,The beach in front of the Hyatt Regency is stunning. Very clean with clear water. Also being a private beach you do not get hassled by sellers.,5,2020-02-01

sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"Don't be mislead by the picture of a children's play pool. This was a lovely little garden that had many parts.  Throughout there were statues  of Hindu gods, but there were also many other things.  There were sculptures of different styles, and a butterfly garden and a cafe which served banana fritters whch came with the price of admission.  While we waited for our fritters, there was a woman selling oils who offered free massages!",4,2020-04-22
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"Our first place we visited after arriving in Bali the night before. Taxi driver wasnt sure where it was until i showed him on the map, he ended up staying for 2 hours waiting for us to take us back to hotel. Kids enjoyed it and was amazed with all the things to see. Didnt know about the water park bit so didnt have our swimming stuff.",4,2020-03-30
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"My 4yo enjoyed walking around, especially the butterflies. The indoor play area was handy for my 1yo whilst my 4yo swam, but it was quite dirty. The splash zone was nice to cool off in. Kids were free.",4,2020-03-16
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"This is close to Sanur and easy to find. The gardens are beautiful. We did not use the pool / kids area this visit. The added prices for small things inside should be discontinued. ie pay to sit on a 'nest' which you would only do for a quick  photo. Worth a look, good area for kids in the pool. Also good for those who like to take photos.",4,2020-03-14
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,Place recommended by a friend who hadn’t been there in a couple of years - think he would have been shocked by the entry fee which is now 150K- also gets you a fried banana fritter with entry - we were fairly underwhelmed expecting more of a variety of statues- the re cycled plastics ones were interesting - lots of spots if you like doing Instagram pictures of self and friends. Would be fun for small children at water park end but I’d agree with previous comments- save your money. I’d have rather spent time browsing a little further down the road in one of the many statue outlets -,2,2020-03-10

sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,What a lovely experience. Would be a great spot for kids. Great displays easy to walk around with a waterpark for the kids to play and cool off.,4,2020-02-09
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"When to these gardens and wasnt sure what to expect as we had only ever seen photos.  Beautfiul gardens and very creative structures of animals and fauna.  We went early in the morning when it was cooler and not so busy.  Ideal for all, definately suggest a visit.",5,2020-01-26
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,We went for lunch and it is lovely. The entry is now 150 rupiah per adult but this included a banana fritter and a good neck and shoulder massage. The gardens are great with plenty of shade and the sculptures are amazing.,5,2020-01-18
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,The garden was good to explore some pretty impressive statues and art. But the entry cost was very pricy for what it included. Water park was poorly maintained and had dirty water.,2,2020-01-07
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"10 times cheaper it would make senseSmall garden with some statues, trees and few children activities. Just a stop on a busy road in Bali for 30-45 minutes maximum.450K for a family of 3 is ridiculous for what they offer.Avoid.",1,2020-01-05
sanur,Big_Garden_Corner,"No chance to take picture outdoor as it is overcrowded. The water play and indoor playground are small, dark and dirty. The fee of Rp. 100k for water play and indoor playground are not worth it. They charge lower for local. It looks very popular for local, but not suitable for tourist.",2,2020-01-02
sanur,Sindhu_Beach,"Not many people, great view, cafe nearby, most of all, you can see lots of diverse fish when you’re snorkling here. Don’t need to go far, just go to the point where seaweed is long enough. There are even some big fishes.",5,2021-09-04

sanur,Sindhu_Beach,There are many beaches in this area and this one was rank as one of our favourites. It is a really laid-back place with an authentic feel about it and the locals seem to enjoy their time there as well as tourists.There are tons of places to get food and drink and often for not very much money at all. It is very flat for walking and the sea is very calm.,4,2020-02-24
sanur,Sindhu_Beach,"Really nice stretch of beach with a heap happening. Warungs, bars, restaurants, hotels and cafes. Would definitely recommend exploring by bike along the bike path over than walking as there is so much to see.",5,2020-02-17
sanur,Sindhu_Beach,Shindu Beach is one of there most relaxing and laid back areas in Sanur. Panoramic views along the coast line and beautiful beach. Take in a restaurant on. the beach or take a stroll into the market to find a bargain.,4,2020-01-10

sanur,Pura_Tirta_Empul_Segara_Merta_Sari,"Great experience.  Take a sarong!  If you're older, overweight or unfit, it may be a challenge to get in and out of the water, as the steps is very high and slippery!  Be careful.  Recommend.",5,2020-02-07
sanur,Pura_Tirta_Empul_Segara_Merta_Sari,"The guide was very nice to us. He was there every step of the way. The place is very sacred.

sanur,Pura_Tirta_Empul_Segara_Merta_Sari,Great experience with cultures worshipping in the endless supply of spring water  Many water showers for blessings are here The only down fall is when leaving your funnelled to the markets with rude arrogant store holders Won’t go back here for that reason Like coyotes on a baby lamb 🤬🤬🤬,3,2020-01-27

sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"The store was rebranded recently and now goes under the name Artesadana. We popped in the other day  - 2 security men on the door busy with their phones. No sanitiser or temperature checks. We wanted some wine and saw a brand that we like advertised on a roll up outside the wine shop. Went in to look but not only didn't they have any of the brand advertised but the lethargic young man couldn't see why it was not a good idea to be advertising it as they didn't have it. They do have lovely fish but the veggies all packed in plastic leave to be desired. We couldn't buy batteries for heaven sake either.Went back again today as we were passing and again no sanitiser despite there being a little table  where it should have been and a sign saying to sanitise hands. When we mentioned it we got a shrug and a "" no have, run out.""  Inside the store there was one tiny hand sanitiser on one of the checkouts.  We were again met with a shrug when we mentioned the disregard of safety advice. Won't go again. We'll use Popular who always have sanitiser and who clean the trolleys.",2,2020-05-12
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"Has changed names and prices for clothes are a lot dearer than before, nearly double to what you can get on the street for same items.. toilets are still same make sure you have tissues or wipes as you only have water hose lol haha.. not worth the visit unless you need some food and essentials..",2,2020-03-09
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,We have been to Hardy's many times and always did our shopping there but no more. This trip we found it to be very expensive and poor quality.the grocery section was very smelly and staff are not helpful or friendly at all. Sadly we will not return but will go to Coco mart or popular mart. We found that souvenirs were cheaper in matahari in Kuta and a lot better quality and choice.,1,2020-03-03
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"This is a store we have used a lot over the years but we weren’t impressed this time. The stock seems to be of poor quality and the variety not great.Also, it isn’t cheap. Even the local shops offered better value for money which is amazing considering the size of this place.Security is good as you have to check any bags in before you go to the airport style gates.The best part of it is the supermarket which is well stocked but again quite expensive in my opinion.",3,2020-02-24
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"Have shopped here many times over the years during our visits to Sanur, have lots of different foods in downstairs supermarket and lots of clothing,toys, souvenirs etc. upstairs. All items are at fixed prices and generally can be bought cheaper elsewhere.Groceries- try Coco Mart or Popular Express.",3,2020-02-17
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,I enjoyed this place. Got to browse and try on clothes without being hassled. Prices are very reasonable clothes and shoe wise. Souvenir wise they might be a bit overpriced but again not being hassled is worth the extra 30cents i'd gain for me.,5,2020-02-13
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"Most of the stuff in there can be bought on the street for much less.  Still, a nice place and well presented.",3,2020-02-07
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"Two levels of goods.  Grocery section downstairs but the smell was overwhelming and we were unable to shop here.  Looked clean.  Went upstairs to other products and purchased some clothing, shoes and giftware.  All reasonably priced but not cheap.  You could most likely barter cheaper prices with stall holders.  Good if you are short on time and need to shop quickly.  Wouldn't rush to this place as I am sure there are other places that would be better.",3,2020-01-20
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,Found Hardy’s to be worth a short walk from the hotel. They had most things anyone would need. My wife picked up some ladies shorts from there. About double the price on the street but she does did not want to go through the hassle of haggling at the time and could take her time having a look. Lots and lots  of ladies clothes in particular upstairs. There is a very good supermarket for any groceries or fruit and veg you might need. There is also a wine store where we were able to grab some $20 - $30 AUD red wines.Be prepared to leave back packs at the storage counter out the front and they give you a number to collect it afterwards. They let us take in our small bum bags but that was it. I would not say it’s a must visit or anything but worth it if you need essentials. Much better than the small coco marts.,4,2020-01-17
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"Unless you have a particular desire to browse without discussion and/or distraction I wouldn't bother. Overpriced souvenir stuff and average to below supermarket items. There is a deli meat and cheese section if you are craving that kind of food, but overall hardly worth the effort IMO. Wine store inside had plenty of choice if you are looking for a particular bottle.",2,2020-01-14
sanur,Hardy_s_Sanur,"It’s just a market and not really “something to do.” The grocery section is pretty good with a great produce selection. Housewares, clothing, and stuff you can buy just about anywhere. You come here to buy food, mostly. There is a bookstore next door.",3,2020-01-04
sanur,Sanur_Morning_Market,"Went early, not ,much going on , some stalls selling fresh veg and meats but not all hall busy with traders. Ok for a look if you have never seen farmers market overseas before.",3,2020-02-04
sanur,Peek_A_Boo,Great place for the kids to stay fit and healthy while also learning new skills. Eugene is such a brilliant instructor and gets the most out of the children.,5,2021-01-05
sanur,Peek_A_Boo,"Perhaps a little tired looking but this is Asia not UK! Excellent little cafe in the middle with tea, coffee, burgers and good snack food. You'll need socks but only 10k and entry is 110k for 3hrs including two adults. Lots of toys, play areas, massive outdoor slide/run around combo with swings and inside in air-conditioning there are things like ballpits and play houses. Perfect for holiday escape from the heat. Would recommend for small children to let off steam.",4,2020-02-19
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,"beautiful pieces of legendary artist home and gallery are not maintained well - that could be a significant place. managed by government? should be managed privately or by corporate  to have quality, cleanliness and maintenance. so sad.",1,2021-07-09
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,"I live in Sanur and walk the beach most days, passing Le Mayeur museum every time I do, but I had never been inside before. I didn't know what to expect and kept open mind. I had however visited the Bali Museum at Jalan Mayor Wisnu in Denpasar. To be honest, Remco Koster's review of Le Mayeur nails it. By today's Western standards, this museum makes a very modest attraction. That said, I think it needs to be seen in context. It's the story of a Western painter who came to Bali before the advent of mass tourism and fell in love with a local Balinese woman. There's nothing earth shattering here.",1,2020-02-02
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,If staying in Sanur do catch a cab to vist Le Mayeur museum. You will likely be the only one visiting and can walk through the 3 main rooms at your own pace. I especially loved the black and white photos of Le mayeur’s wife Pollock. You can sense what it would have been like to live here at a stone throw from the ocean. Some lovely paintings both of his time in Bali and in southern Europe.,4,2020-01-25
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,"This museum is in a sad state; terrible maintenance, faded paintings (mostly replicas or terrible quality framed photos of paintings, no fan, no airco; nobody is interested to explain anything about anything; only to take the money. Don’t waste your time visiting this ‘museum’.",1,2020-01-11
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,"Located off the beachfront path the museum is well signposted. TA map is excellent for finding location.Admission charges apply - quite reasonable.Some of the artwork is original whilst some are substituted with photographs. The display cases of perspex are less than adequate to display - it is sometimes impossible to see the painting and certainly impossible to photograph. The art lacks vibrancy and fails to captivate me. The art does not appeal to me, but that’s not to says it’s poor or that it will not appeal to others. The presentation is poor and would benefit from renovation / modernisation. Le Mayeur’s model seems to have been a prisoner to his passions, but there again, who am I to comment. Personally it was a disappointing visit.",3,2020-01-10
sanur,Le_Mayeur_Museum,This was rated highly in our Lonely Planet guide to Bali. We were disappointed. There was an absence of information on the artworks many of which did not appear to be well preserved and which may soon be lost if not better cared for. There was nobody around to answer questions and possibly the most interesting thing to me was the opportunity to see the inside of a traditional Balinese house. I think there is so much more which could have been done with what was a fascinating subject. One thing which I thought was off was that there was no consideration of the fact a 57 year old man married a 15 year old girl after knowing her for three years. The other thing is that you should take care to ensure you have gone to the toilet before you get there.,2,2020-01-04
sanur,Arthamas_Express,I was a bit worried about getting boats from Bali to the surrounding islands after seeing some poor reviews. I travelled between Sanur and Nusa Lembongan twice with Artamus Express and would recommend them to other travellers. They include transfers both ends in the ticket price which is really helpful.,4,2020-03-02
sanur,Arthamas_Express,"i m very satisfied with them, their price is good also they didnt charge for my 2years (25months) old child, under3years old infant no need to charge, other companies dont charge under2. i was planning to stay at nusa lembongan for four days, they pick me up from my hotel which was at ubud and took me to the hotel where i booked at nusa lembongan.later i wanted to extend my stay at nusa lembongan and i contact with them and they changed my return ticket without any charge",5,2020-02-06
sanur,Arthamas_Express,"I bought sanur-nusa lembongan round trip ticket from its website, and used its arthamas20 code for 20% off. And they still gave me free Bali Hai beer! In short, the trip was felt 'professional'. In Sanur they have a check-in counter and boarding area (like in the airport), and in Nusa Lembongan they have their own restaurant property. The guy that picked us up from the hotel was on-time, professional, and informative. Feels that this company has a high working standard.",5,2020-02-05
sanur,Arthamas_Express,We found Arthamas Express very professional and punctual. I was concerned about some of the reviews I’d read about other companies but we felt extremely safe with Arthamas. There were plenty of visible life jackets under the seats and the staff were very helpful both in Sanur and Lembongan. The transfers from the airport and back to our accommodation in Seminyak were great too. Would definitely use them again. Thanks so much guys. 👍🏼👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼,5,2020-01-22
sanur,Arthamas_Express,We booked the boat to lembongan from Ubud using Dangap dangap tours. The pickup and return were included in the price (200k per person each way) and we were picked up from outside our hotel at 10:15 (exactly when they said we would be). The journey from Ubud to Sanur tool about 40 mins and the fast boat takes about 30 mins to get to lembongan. I would recommend this company. Everything went smoothly and was very professional. They whatsapp you frequently to check there are no issues.,5,2020-01-18
sanur,Arthamas_Express,"Our hotel in Lembongan called the pick up service. We were informed that Arthamas car will pick up us up at 10:30 latest, the boat was scheduled to leave  11. We were early and waited 45minutes. Hotel whatsapped Arthmas driver several times and driver anserwered that he is coming. At 11:00 the hotel driver drove us to the harbour. We noticed that Arthamas driver was already there (so they forgot to pick us up) and the boat was about to leave. Luckily we handled the transportation by ourselves, otherwise would have missed the boat. the boat trip itself was tolerable, boat smaller than in the pictures, hard to fit three adults to next to each other. Luckily weather was ok, not too windy, but it was really really hot inside the boat.",2,2020-01-06
sanur,Karang_Beach,Karang beach is one of my fav beach in sanur because of the view that you could get here for sunrise is perfect!,4,2021-05-10
sanur,Karang_Beach,"If you're in Bali and look for yoga exercise on the beach for free, you should come to Karang Beach at Sanur. This beach is my favorite place to do yoga. The yoga practice starts at 7 am daily, everyone is advised to bring their own mat. Find your favorite spot to enjoy the exercise. Mine is under the tree and in front of the sea, where it isn't too bright and I still can enjoy the view. There's a professional yoga instructor who teaches yoga there. Karang beach is also famous for favourite spot to take sunrise. So you can come around 6 am and wait for the sunrise, then continue with yoga exercise. What I don't like about this place is, there are many dogs around while we're practicing yoga. And the beach is dirty in some areas. However, this beach is still a nice place to visit and to enjoy. Do yoga on the beach and stay healthy while you're on vacation!",4,2020-12-30

sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"Boat service was fine no problems with it. We purchased a return trip with transfer to ubud which stated on ticket drop off ubud center. The driver said it was 50,000 more to get dropped off outside hotel (showed him on map where). I said no we have paid more than enough. He then proceeded to drop us off not in ubud central but the bottom of the road our accommodation was situated. He then drove with two remaining passengers up the same road our hotel is on leaving us behind in 30+° weather with two big suitcases and around 1km walk. Avoid these guys at all costs!!!! Shame on the driver and the company 😡😡😡",1,2020-03-16
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"After reading all the reviews on the internet, I was so scared to travel with them. On 1 good review there was 6 bad ones, ppl reporting money being stolen from their luggages, loud music etc... I was soo scared, thank all of you... 1) in the Nusa Penida office they have a sign which literally says: we advise you not to store any valuables in the luggage going below the deck... So if you still do that... That's your own problem. 2) yes the music was loud as 7 hells, but in my trip it was mostly bc all of the ppl on the top floor of the boat, we're young ""kids"" going to party island and they were playing it... 3) Yes, the crew was smoking all the way to the harbour, but same as half of the passengers on the top floor... 4) yes, they were asking ppl if they want a beer, but if you aren't sure it's not for free (just think about this - nothing is for free in this world 🤦🏽) ask the crew and don't write stupid reviews about them giving out ""what looks like free beer but it wasn't"" bc if you don't ask it's your problem. 5) ppl also complain about delays... Can't deny that, but my trip was even slightly faster than it should be. All depends on the weather. 6) They took us in the small boat which took us to the Golden Queen... Yes it's part of the trip, it was lil bit tricky but nothing undoable. Captain on my trip was very nice guy. I enjoyed it, even tho the music was too loud.",4,2020-03-04
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"I got a boat to Gili Air from Sanur and then did the return trip 5 days later. Both tickets were sold as 3.5 hours in travel time. Both trips took around 5 hours. There is no forward planning with this service which means you can sit at docks for over 20 minutes. When docked, the boat is switched off which means air con is gone. The boat quickly becomes very hot and stuffy and the fumes from petrol get overwhelming and made me feel nauseous every time. One of the male boat crew took my bag at Gili Air for the trip back to Sanur. I noticed about an hour into the trip that he was at the back of the boat with my bag and was sleeping on it! He slept on it for at least an hour and a half after I noticed. I took my bag to sit with me after the boat docked at one of the stops. This man then came back to my row of seating and sat in the chair one seat down from me (3 seats per row) and blocked me and my bag in the row. There were plenty of other seats as the boat was mostly empty. After the next dock, I was the only person left in the cabin, yet he still loitered around me. As a solo female traveler, I felt quite uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend this company. Their time management is terrible, their staff are either creepy or immature and smoke and muck around constantly. It's not a cheap company so spend your money elsewhere.",2,2020-02-20
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"Caught the boat to Gili and it was 30 min delayed. Only seats left was on the top deck and the staff, who played too loud music without checking in on the customers. They seemed to want to have their own party. The worse thing however was the chainsmoking staff members, who lit cigarettes 50cm from your head (I couldn’t move to another seat because there were none, and frankly, I shouldn’t have to move seat because of the staff )... they didn’t seem to be bothered by trickering my asthma attack with their non-stop smoking. The staff were mainly there to service themselves. Would not recommend.",2,2020-02-18
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"I had three boat transfers in Bali and this was by far the worst one! Do no use! Spare yourself the pain. The crew is unprofessional (dancing singing), inappropriate music is being blasted for 2 hours straight and the crew is constantly smoking (as can be seen in the picture I'm uploading).Avoid at all cost!",1,2020-01-19
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"I don’t know what are other people talking about, but if you are not a magic idiot or aussie - it is the best boat service around Bali and islands. Comfortable fast boat, cold beers during the trip (yes it’s paid) and transfer to the Villa, and only 200k IDR more than a regular boat with tons of tourists. Easy check-in, and comfortable seats. Will recommend to all of my friends!!!",5,2020-01-15
sanur,Golden_Queen_Fast_Boat,"men on boat walked around giving out beers to everyone while dancing and then after asked everyone to pay 40,000 idr which was stupid because they made out like it would be for free. Then they turned the music off and made us do the journey in silence because they were annoyed people had an issue with the drinks. Very rude and AWFUL service DO NOT GO WITH THEM",1,2020-01-10

We had no idea where the ferry would leave from. Had to bring all our bags ourself, unlike other campanies that will take your larger bags, and bring them in/out of the boat. While ferry arrived, the passengers had a hard time to leave the boat and collect their bags. Some were in the back, some in the front - No information were given.. And the place was allready to packed to move around. and people waiting to get onboard was waiting forever to board the boat. Trying to bring the bags to the back of the boat first, only to be told to go forward. All while roasting the the sun, and beeing stressed. No real information given.after the struggle to get onboard, Tiny window trough the side. The boat was superpacked. people and bags crammed together. terrible small seats. My friend is 161, and her knee was jamed into the seat in front. unable to move .Bags in the middle is the aisle, could not move around. Warm as a terrible sauna. Horrible stank of sweatwindows along the side of the boat was leaking water in, but still we had to keep them open to get some fresh air in. Door and emergency point were tied down with ropes. Deathtrap if anything were to go wrong. like a fire. Internet sites, booking and their times are not updated. Normally I don't bother writing the bad reviews, but this company deserve every bad review they can get. we used 3 different companies, and I wouldn't get on this boat again, even if they gave me money.

sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"I’m aware that most reviews are very negative on here however I travelled with Semaya and whilst timings were a bit off (but that’s just standard in Asia), we couldn’t fault them. From booking, to pick up, we felt like they were a well run, informative company. Yes the boats are hot and full but they’re a business!! Why wouldn’t they sell tickets until the boat is full?? Unfortunately we had to leave the island early due to coronavirus and wanted to keep the island virus free. We found this out from the man who sold us our tickets in Sanur, he actually rang us about 10 times to check we were ok. We were given clear instruction on where to go when and yes we had to wait but it wasn’t ridiculous and in light of the situation it was pretty calm. Our bags were loaded on and off by the employees with no trouble, and my bag was heavy!! Just be aware that taxi drivers swamp all boats when they arrive back from the islands which is a bit disconcerting but again, we were warned by the company as they gave us a free shuttle afterwards to Seminyak. As long as you understand that you have to wait in Asian countries then it’s a decent option. If you don’t like waiting, don’t go to Asia 😆",4,2020-03-18
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"A bad experience both ways!The boat was almost an hour late departing toLembongan. When we returned there was no transport we waited and waited whilst continuing to ask when the driver would arrive. We ended up arranging and paying for another driver ourselves! Terrible service and it’s not our first time with fast boats in Bali. We have used them on many, many occasions but this is however my only bad review. Do yourself a favor and travel with another company!",1,2020-03-09
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"We took the fast boat from bali to nusa penida with a return trip and two bus transfers included.The boat was an hour late to nusa penida and we stopped mid trip due to the engine cutting out and were therefore just bobbing around for 10 minutes. The boat back was slightly better but still arrived late.When it got to the return bus transfer back to Canggu Central, It got even worse. Our driver dropped us at the bottom of Seminyak and told us to get out as we were here. We told him we weren't in central Canggu as we have knowledge of the area and the driver began to flip out. He started shouting ""fine I'll drop you back at the port then"" to which we obviously said no. We were so far away to from central Canggu we stopped the bus from leaving. The driver started swearing at us and at one point tried pushing us out the way of the bus. We had to get a taxi to central Canggu which was 70k which just shows how far we actually were. The whole thing was an absolute con! P.s. I've attached some beautiful photos of our c*** of a driver so you know who to avoid :)",1,2020-03-08
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,I felt like a cattle getting transported to the slaughter house. Perhaps at the end of the trip I forgot that I am human.The speed boat (?Sheep Goat) arrived 30 minutes late and sadly everyone including little children had to wait for another hour in the hot burning Sun as they had engine issues which was being fixed. It Appears like staff are overworked as they were the only Balinese people I saw who were literally yelling at their customers.The boat stopped in the middle of the ocean.I normally don't write a review but this time I was compelled so that others can at least choose a another safe boat.,1,2020-03-03
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"It gets you from a to b but you'll have to do some fighting. I took this ferry from bali- Gili T and back. The trip over was fine, no drama. The trip back was awful; the ferry was over 2h late but that's fine,it happens with other ferry companies as well. However as it was the last ferry, we ended up getting to Sanur after 7pm. It was dark and raining and everyone just wanted to get home. The staff quickly gathered us for the shuttles and then it all went wrong. They started asking for more money to get a drop off directly to the hotel (they asked me for 200k, otherwise they said they would just drop me off in Central seminyak and that it would take at least 4h). I obviously refused to pay, as I had made sure I paid for a return hotel shuttle when I booked my tickets. They tried to get other people pay 300k extra EACH L, otherwise they would put them on a bus with 25 other people and it would take 6h to get to seminyak.These were all lies. The shuttles don't even take more than 15ppl or so.As expected, no body paid and everyone got dropped off at their hotels and I was in  Seminyak in 2h.I have been in Bali for almost 2 year and NEVER have I been lied to so badly. This company is a disgrace and seeing how they tried to take advantage of their guests was disgusting. Surely the staff just wanted to keep the money for themselves...Never again.

sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"Worse ferry experience ever. To go from Nusa Penida to Gili T it took almost 6 hours. 3 stops and 1 transfert (that took 2 hours standing on the pier crowded on the sun). Everything is chaotic and non efficient. Once on the boat the bad experience continues... too crowed, dirty, wet, smelly, bad seats, no air conditioning and windows closed because of the water coming in. Suffocating! Arrival on the beach, your luggage are thrown on the sand and water. To get back from Gili to Bali, same thing! Both trips the boat was 1 to 2 hours late. BAD BAD BAD experience.

sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"Yo, I read a lot of reviews for this company so believe me at the beginning I almost threw away my tickets after I bought them and was trying to buy new ones with different company. LUCKILY all the ships were fully booked so we sticked with Semaya One. I realized that actually all those reviews are wrote by a lot of sensitive people that probabbly came to Indonezia and have no clue that this country works a bit different then Western countries ! The guy in the Harbour told me that going earlier is better because of course the sea is calmer. He was right. But let's get to the whole experience. Of course it was full of people, but there was a lot free seats also. Of course it was a bit hot inside, but not like I read here of course. Ships jumped couple times, but it's the small ship not a cruise on a damn open sea, what do you expect ? We travelled with 5 kids, none of them had an issue.Crew didn't speak that much, but if you read all the instructions in the boat, you will never get scammed. So don't show ticket to anyone in the harbour if you bought also transfer with shuttle, go straight to semaya one office and you are completely safe ! It's annoying to go thtu all of these scammers in the harbour, but once we left them behind we got an transfer with shuttle straight to our Villa in UBUD. No issues.Don't be scared, it's allright. I am pretty sure other companies are nearly the same.",5,2020-02-19

sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,I think most people know that any of the boat transfers to Gili T are fairly average. And they don't get particularly good reviews. This fast ferry used today. Was unusually bad. It was obviously late. It was packed with people and bags. At gili t  it was just a free-for-all. Once we got the pandang bay after a fairly horrible ride there was still more chaos. No one seems to be in charge. If I could find a better way to go to Gili T I definitely would.,1,2020-02-10
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"Boat is super hot and packed, also was 1 hour late to pick us up. The really bad part of the experience was the “shuttle” back to your hotel... packed 13 people in a 7 person van and tried to pack even more people in...driver wanted people to sit on the floor?? And then they don’t drop you off directly at your hotel so we ended up having to walk almost 30 minutes. Would have been way less hassle and more safe to just take a taxi (and probably the same price too). Wish we would’ve read reviews prior to booking with this company.",1,2020-02-09
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"AVOID this company if you can! Yes, thsi company is a bit cheaper than others,  BUT trust me, you will be happy to pay more first minutes when they will pickup you from yoru hotel or you load into the boat! It is dangeriously over crowded boat. I'm sure, they sell more tickets than the boat can carry, because some of passangers were standing. Boat crew are terrable, they offered my wife and my 5 years daughter to sit in separate rows of the boat, and when we told them that our child msut sit with mom or dad, they shoted "" that every time is the same"".. our luck some polike and understanding tourists changed their seets and we could sit together. The trip was very uncomfortable. Another story is the shuttle from Ubud to Padang Bai port - worst ride ever. The driver was late 1 hour and obviously in a hurry and drove so dangerously. We used many other boat companies before for travelling to Gilis and i can tell you this one is WORST! So one more time, please avoid and always ask travel counters when buying trip to gilis what company they are using.",1,2020-01-26
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"We travelled from Gili T to Canggu. Our ticket cost RP250,000 each with a bit of haggling. The guy said this includes a bus straight to our hotel. On Gili T, getting on the boat was fine and getting our ticket was fine. When we sat down we realised just how small and cramped this boat was, with people’s suitcases lining the sides of the gangway down the boat. There were air-con vents but no air-con. The windows had to be closed because the waves were kicking up water that was being blown in. We were sat about half way down the boat and we could not feel any air flow at all. There was some space at the back of the boat to stand with the staff but not much space for many people. Thankfully we had a small electric fan with us, if we didn’t have it we would have suffered. The whole boat journey took around 2 hours - stopping at Gili Air and Bangsal before heading to Padang Bai. When we finally reached Padang Bai, we were escorted by a guy telling us he was taking us to our shuttle bus (a minivan). The guy says it goes to Canggu town but not our hotel. I try argue with him but he says the guys on Gili T don’t know the rules in Bali (lame excuse). Taxis are all over offering to go direct for an hour journey instead of this shuttle bus which takes 3-4 hours. We decide to stick with the minivan. My friend and I are crammed at the back with the bags - thankfully we’re not big people or we would’ve been squashed. The journey takes around 90 minutes - not 3-4 hours like they kept saying. It stops somewhere random in Canggu. The driver says we can pay an extra RP100,000 to be dropped off at the hotel. I’m pissed off now. Lied to twice and not at our hotel - the driver shrugs. He doesn’t care. My friend has already booked us a Grab car for cheaper and we finally put an end to the worst journey we’ve ever had in Bali. I’ll never travel with them again - neither should you.",1,2020-01-20

sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"I usually did not write reviews but i can not hold myself in writing the review for Semaya one. I Traveled with Semaya one 3 times as recently as 2nd Jan and 4th Jan 2020. Before booking with them i have read all the reviews and i was prepared for all the consequences. I booked the fast boat to travel between Nusa Penida to Gili Air and Back to Bali. The online price was showing was very high. So as suggested by many fellow traveler, i decided to book the boat by going to Harbor. The price i got was 350.000 IDR (Because first they will transport me to Padang Bai and then to Gili Air) as there is no direct Fast boat from Nusa Penida to Gili Air. The boat was little late while leaving from Nusa Penida. They gave us stickers which we need to stick to luggage and on our T Shirt. They organised our bags well. the journey from NP to PB was not that long. But we had to wait nearly 2 hours as the boat came late from Lombok. When we started boarding they organized the luggage well, Gili T passengers they put luggage separately, Gili A and Lombak they put luggage separately. Pretty good. They had given clear instructions. The journey was smooth and Bumpy but good. Return Journey they clearly mentioned that we have to tell them 1 day before when we to travel. I have seen many people just walk in and asking them to board. They were nice enough to board those people which leads to people standing in the boat lot of luggage. As a traveler we also should know if there are rules we need to follow them. I had informed them one day in advance and my name they put in the Boarding list. Smooth. While boarding there were clear instructions given on Harbor that once we reach Bali we have to go to their office in order to get free shuttle, do not hand over the shuttle pass to anyone on boat. Clear instructions given. I have read about the scam of taxi drivers do on the boat so i was relaxed. In the return journey like i said there were lot of people came at last minute because of which they were standing. I mean there should be some system to be followed by boat company (Thats the reason why i had given 4 stars in stead of 5 :)). Anyways the ride was bumpy because there was lot of rains and sea was a little rough. Sea Sick people were vomiting and the staff was providing them carry bags. We reach pretty much on time. Once we reach PB there were lot of drivers,touts came on boat and asking for taxi service many people give away their free shuttle pass to them (Which later had to pay a lot of money to travel to Bali Main land and these are the same people who will tell that they got scammed. If they follow the instructions they will not see the scam)  Long story short. You will get the service depending upon how much you pay. The return ticket from PB to Gili Air is 500.000 IDR. If you compare that with Eka Jaya or Golden Queen its less. Thats why there are no AC a little crowded. But i enjoyed the travel (I may be lucky) and definitely recommended",4,2020-01-09
sanur,Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,DONT USE THIS SHIP!!!!!!! we booked boat to gili and from gili to bali. our boat didnt leave at all and when we tried to get our money back they blocked our numbers and wouldnt give money back.

He showed us some parts of it on the drive back out to the exit. Lots of garbage. Took photos to educate the pupils at my school back on UK.,1,2020-02-22
sanur,Sri_Rejeki_Express,Sri Rejeki is a well organised company. The process to check in at Sanur was great as was the boat trip. Our price included transfers from our hotel in Legian to Sanur and then from the beach in Lembongan to our hotel. And back again the other way from our hotel to the boat and then a transfer onto our resort in Seminyak. It was very seamless. We would definitely use Sri Rejeki Express again the next time we head to Lembongan.,5,2020-03-16

sanur,El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"I booked a day trip to Nusa Penida with my girlfriend. Taxi transfer collected us at 6:30 am to head to the dock to get the boat to Nusa Penida. Boat was fine have no complaints about that. When we arrived in Nusa Penida we were put into a taxi with another couple. When we booked this tour it was advertised as a private taxi with air-conditioning. I've no problems sharing a taxi if it's advertised as sharing but why say private taxi when it's not. When we got into the taxi we noticed there was no air-conditioning. The other couple in the taxi with us decided to make a complaint to the head office because we were not going to be stuck in a car with no air-conditioning for 8 hours when it is 30 degrees outside and if we weren't getting a car with air-conditioning we wanted a refund. The manager we spoke to informed us that when we reached the next desitination (broken beach) we would get a new taxi with air-conditioning. When we reached the next destination we were informed that the other couple in the car would be moved to another car with air-conditioning but we would be left in the taxi without air-conditioning. Why is it ok to treat people like this? We paid the same amount as the other couple but we were left in the car without air-conditioning. We rang the manager we spoke to earlier and she couldn't see the problem. I've never been so frustrated in my life speaking to someone so incompetent. We refused to continue in the taxi without air-conditioning until they had a resolution to the problem. We explained that we wouldn't off left the harbour if we knew that we wouldn't of been in a car with air-conditioning as advertised in there day trip. We wanted a refund as for the amount we paid we should have been treated better, the manager said that we couldn't get a refund as we already left the harbour. It's a joke, I honestly will never use your company due to your customer service being the worst I have encountered in my life. In the end we just continued in the car without air-conditioning instead of dealing with your manager. At the end of the tour someone from the company approached us to see if we wanted to book another trip and we told him where to go. Don't bother using this company, it's not worth it.",1,2020-03-13
sanur,El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"This was a very disappointing experience with many safety and health concerns.We were picked up from our hotel at 6.15 am and taken the Sanur. The drivers did not speak any English and was hard to get any additional information. We were only able to pay in cash which meant we needed to carry in excessive of $1500 to pay for the privilege. We were all loaded into the ferry (not boat) and were required to wait an additional 30 minutes in a very crowded ferry for 2 passengers who were running late!! It was extremely hot in the ferry and many people started to feel unwell. There was no instructions on life jackets or location or any evacuation plan available. On arrival at the island there was very little information on the tour. We were taken to a small room to get our fins fitted. They did not have enough fins to go around and we were told it didn’t matter as “you won’t be snorkelling anyway” we I challenged them that said they can give me a life jacket to swim with instead. The life jackets were in poor condition with broken buckles and tied.During the booking process we were told we would be provided with water, towels, lunch, a guide and insurance. We were provided with 300mls of water each, on request and we asked for more we were told “no more ”!.  Due to no instructions we were required to get changed on the boat. (No one want to see a 50 year old changing into her bathers - I can tell you right now!). The guide told us to stay with him, however did not wait for the weaker swimmers. No towels were provided, until we returned to the island. Be aware There are no toilets stops on the tour boat!Lunch is street food, The menu contained spring rolls -which we felt would be safe to eat, we were told they were sold out. However when paying customers come in they were served spring rolls. On complaining numerous times they served us spring rolls too. All other food was served luke-warm with precooked eggs. The following day 4 people from our party became unwell with vomiting. On returning to Sanur we travelled on a ferry which was in poor condition, with broken seats and  the lock on the front exit was broken so the crew tied the only front exit shut with rope, which would have prevented us leaving the vessel in an emergency. On returning we were transferred back to the hotel as part of the package. Both drivers drove erratically with one driver, on many occasions, driving on the wrong side of the road to pass traffic build up  and drove excessively fast. We are all well travelled, and have been to Bali many time before and undertaken many tours in the past and this would be the most disappointing operator we have experienced. In saying of this I would recommend doing the snorkelling, however not with this company.",1,2020-03-01

They were very kind and even gave me a piggyback to get to the boat dry as my foot has an injury and should not touch the water.Also they carried all our luggage to and from the boat.The boat was on time and the cruise was very calm even though we heard it is better to go in the morning.,5,2020-02-08

We paid at Sanur booth and we were told this included transfer to our hotel.  I confirmed this 3 times and all 3 times I was told ""don't worry, someone will be waiting at the dock to give you a ride to your hotel"". The boat was late boarding and leaving. When we arrived at Nusa Penida and transferred to another smaller boat, I asked a few crew members who I was supposed to meet when we got on shore, they blew me off.  When we got to the beach, the boat was immediately flooded with cab drivers and I wanted to make sure we were picked up (as we'd already paid for transfer to hotel), the 3 guys on the boat I tried asking totally blew me off and the one who understood English told me to just get off the boat and there would be someone there.  We got our bags and kept telling drivers we had paid for transit, so didn't need a ride.  We kept asking and everyone said they had no idea, so we went to the Tanis booth.  There were 5 guys there only 1 spoke English and he said ticket only was for boat.  This was what I had anticipated at the harbor and been assured would not happen.  A cab driver tried helping, calling our contact back on Bali, but everyone said oh no it's just the boat tickets, no transfer.  There was another group of 4 people who were in the same situation, they had paid for boat ticket and transportation to hotel and had no transfer on arrival.  All 6 of us ended up just paying to get to our rooms a second time, but not a great first impression at all.All I can say is have low expectations for service and make sure you get a ticket that shows PROOF that transfer is included, don't just trust there will be someone waiting for you.",2,2020-01-13

canggu,Canggu_Beach,"Initially the black sands of Canggu Beach are quite novel. As this spot has become THE place to be in Bali, crowds have blemished what once might have been pristine and serene. Plenty of waves to surf and hip bars to visit - the beach seems to be perennially packed these days.",3,2020-11-16
canggu,Canggu_Beach,"Unfortunately this gorgeou beach was covered in rubbish. The little food and drink places along the edge of the walkway were friendly and if looking for basic food , nice views and cold drinks its a great spot. The laid back atmosphere and lovely locals makes is favourite spot though when visiting Bali. We stay here for 1/2 of our Bali trip.",4,2020-07-16
canggu,Canggu_Beach,"Canggu Beach was wonderful and exactly what I wanted for my vacation. I spent three weeks at an Air Bnb that was in walking distance. My criteria: good surfing waves and yoga. The waves: LOVED them. They came in reliably in perfect sets. Wave after wave after wave, and it's a beach break so you don't have to worry about getting killed on the reef. They are long, firm waves, perfect for long boarding. There are enough waves for everyone, and the locals are very nice, friendly, and laid-back. You can rent boards on the beach, or bring your own. The Yoga: There are several yoga studios close by, but I preferred to do my own ashtanga practice before or after surfing, at my air bnb or on the beach.The Beach: Beautiful with deep blue water and a lovely sky. There are stray dogs which will break your heart, but they are not dangerous.",5,2020-06-25
canggu,Canggu_Beach,Great beach a lot of surfersHowever the small shop are in my opinion expensive for bali as well a lot of party bar are open blasting music which can kill the mood,4,2020-06-02
canggu,Canggu_Beach,We knew this was not a white sandy beach but the beach itself had lots of rubbish on it and was so noisy from lots of drunk people in the various bars dotted along the front. Much nicer beaches elsewhere in Bali.,2,2020-04-28

canggu,Canggu_Beach,"After visiting Seminyak in Bali you can definitely see a contrast in Canggu. This is a new and developing neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, bars and cafes. I can see why the younger crowd gravitate here for budget conscious options. Black sand beach with plenty of choice for beachside activities.",4,2020-02-29

canggu,Canggu_Beach,The surf is great and it’s a nice place to watch surfers as well when your having a break. There a Plenty of good little Restraunts and bars near by to relax. There is a lot of rubbish and plastic pollution in the beach and ocean there i picked up a lot I wish I brought more things to collect more rubbish out of the water.

canggu,Canggu_Beach,"If you want a super Western style beach, this is your place. Being from California, I was expecting a very special type of place after hearing that Canggu was voted one of the best beaches in the world, but it was EXACTLY like a California beach. All of the restaurants were catered towards Western cuisine, the most unauthentic part of Bali I'd seen in the whole 3 weeks my boyfriend and I were there.",1,2020-01-20

canggu,Batu_Bolong_Beach,"Don't waste your time coming here, there are many other places to surf in bali. 1. The beach is full of trash and not esthetically pleasing, with dirty water from the river. 2. The vendors increase the price of sitting on their decapitated benches by 100% (if you're purchasing beverages from the vendor you should not pay for the benches per the local balinese) if you pay, you're a sucker! 3. There's a sewer drain leading into the ocean, right next to the over priced benches with umbrellas. I don't know about you but I don't want to pay to sit on the beach and smell sewage.4. If you decide to come here, do not bring any personal belongings, it's not safe, lots of lurking eyes waiting for an oppurtunity.",1,2020-03-20
canggu,Batu_Bolong_Beach,"Always a hive of tourism and local activity...lot's of Hindu ceromonies on the Beach, local fisherman and families, but way too many surfing schools... was once a sleeply little fishing village. Now like the rest of Bali getting too busy..such a shame!",5,2020-03-03

canggu,Alternative_Beach,"This is by far my favourite place to stay in not only Canggu but in the whole of Bali. I’ve visited Bali numerous times and stayed in a variety of hostels / homestays / hotels around the area but this has definitely been my favourite of all; it’s so clean, comfortable and has everything you need, you could stay here and not even want to leave because it has everything right there, a giant pool / jacuzzis / pool bar / café / restaurant / gym / yoga / and even pool parties. I really enjoyed the Saturday pool parties at alternative beach, so fun and the perfect way to socialise and make some great friends... oh and the espresso martinis were one of the best in Canggu!!! ;)",5,2020-03-06

canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,"Hey there,My name is Anja,  I am 35 years old and from Switzerland. Just to mention in the beginning, I have studied before BA and MA and I am used to stressful and challenging situations. But I really have the urge to speak up about this experience.I was sooo... excited and serious about the  200 h YTT and was very disappointed,  unhappy and kind of burned out in the end. Also because there was a very bad vibe and not at all a yoga family feeling. There even was mobbing and people told the owner, there where days when they simply wanted to quit and not showing up no more):Negative Points:- not as expected - not worth the money!- You dont get the 200 h you actually pay for! It was a stress and rushing through the whole experience (exhausting schedule),  superficial know how transfer (boot camp style) and no time to soak in the knowledge. Even if you took all of the free time.- There was a very monotone feeling after the first week. Every morning the same mantra singing and the same meditation.- The book was written in weird kind of english. And we didnt cross all of the subjects at all. This kind of freaked me out, because I really wanted to get this knowledge by professional teachers.- one girl who complained about some points,  got mobbed out by the owner. He wrote her tons of texts, even late at night and it felt like brainwashing her. He told her she would get back some of the money. Which in the end wasnt the case. He first didnt responded anymore, as she really decided to drop out... I mean, for real? Now they have a case with lawyers.- All in one very unserious (everyone got the diploma. Even if they didnt showed up for  the 90% attendance. On the practical  exam day we had the opportunity to put some notes UNDER out yoga mat and look some time, if it should be necessary. One girl had this paper in front of her all the time as she had to teach her first yoga lesson. That was really unprofessional. Also the owner told us many, many answers shortly before the exam. I mean why learning then for 3 weeks?!? Super annoying!--> For example one girl, dropped out of class so many times, she never attended and didnt took the YTT seriously.  Even she missed so many classes during the training  and wasnt prepared at the practical exam day she still passed. That is exactly the kind of Yoga Teacher you dont want or want to be compared like ! This stuff took a lot of my motivation away. As I felt in the end you simply pay for the certificate and that the owner doesnt value the effort you put in at all. - I already mentioned the fact of superficial know how transfer. For example the pranayama (breathing techniques) where looked at for some minutes, after students complained about the lack of knowledge in this topic. Same as meditation and mantra.- Honestly everyone was kind of burned out at some point. We discussed it while having breakfast, but people didnt have the courage to speak up. As they wanted the certificate.- I was personally  looking for the Asana Lab and to learn how to correct the postures. I really dont feel prepared at all in these subjects.- Another thing was the philosophy part, I was so curious about this topic, also because it was teached by a monk. But in the end, a monk is not a teacher. He was talking and talking and no one was listening, or even afraid of asking further questions because  we simply couldnt follow. It would have been nice if a ""normal"" person would teach this topic and then when you understand what its all about, have the chance to discuss with a monk.  Also we had to sit on the floor on basically all the theory lessons, it was just uncomfortable and no one was looking forward to philosophy class no more. The monk himself didnt realize all of this at all. Even after I told him. Let's face it, he is just in another world!- The fact of offering different teachers sound great in the beginning but for me personally the second yoga teacher really just did some kind of fitness class and didnt realize that it simply wasnt our level at all... It felt like a lack of empathy and I was thinking, exactly this kind of teaching is the one I would never ever go for. Surely this is a personal thing of taste.Recommendations:- stick to what you sell- give students the time to soak in knowledge. As I mentioned in my opinion there was a hole week missing. If they could correct this, I guess I would have had a complete different experience.- Be there - be real, be kind and be honest!In the end I got intrigued by a very good marketing on IG. I am very sorry to say but I would not recommend this training at all, as I had not a good experience at all. True Story!I hope you take my review serious and improve some of the points.I wish you just the best,Anja",1,2021-05-05
canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,Last month i did a  100 hour YTT  course here.  For the money I paid for ( which is A LOT) I was expecting much more. First of all I feel confused as I paid for 100hour course and I had only +/- 70hours of classes which was later explained that the rest is the time we should spend learning at home in the evening. Everyday we've  had 10 hours of training starting at 7 am so i have no idea when were we supposed to learn at home (?) as the course itself was really exhausting. Another thing - we did not have teachers that were supposed to be at the course but some other ones instead. I feel like half of the time spent on the course was just a waste of time because it was really often when we sat and read theory from the book. I was expecting much more of physical exercises. There are two aspects that I really enjoyed : morning vinyasa classes and anatomy classes ! They were lovely and this is what made my course :) Apart of these I feel like the course wasn't professional and definitely not worth the money. I would not reccommend this place,2,2021-03-16
canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,"I really enjoyed the diversified teachers we had there, with their own experience and approach, in philosophy, meditation, anatomy, teaching methodology and challenging daily practices. I have progressed a lot and improved in a place with great environmental commitment, which was very important to me.",5,2020-12-21

canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,"I really enjoyed this month. It was a perfect mix of physical challenge, great in depth philosophy, really unic and inspiring teachers from different countries, individual growth and gaining knowledge about alignment, how to teach etc. This training gives you a great insight in different kinds of yoga. So I think the perfect thing for the first 200 hour YTT!The location is amazing, communication is great - couldn't have been better, and I have met many beautiful and inspiring people (teachers & students). Also the food is not only super healthy but also delicious!! I am really grateful for having been able to do my YTT with JogaYoga in Bali! I definitely recommend it and wish all the best to all the new Yoga Teachers:)!Namaste",5,2020-03-06

canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,"This program is in a stunning environment along the beach of Canggu! Any spare moment is spent at the beach. We were told we would be dismissed from class for sunset daily but that seldomly happened. It wasn't clear from the website or social media what day and time we had an opening ceremony so many students completely missed it. I received minimal email communication leading into the training even though I registered early enough for the ""early bird discount."" They don't tell you this, but you can opt out of the housing option and rent an AirB&B for a much better rate and accommodation value. Overall, the program was well worth it. Teachers came from all over the globe to teach. Don't expect to do everything you see on their Instagram or website.",3,2020-01-12
canggu,Joga_Yoga_Training,I love my time that I’ve spend during YTT here with Joga Yoga. The best school for yoga teacher training. Once in a lifetime experience.

canggu,Canggu_Scooter_Lessons,"A lot of bike lessons seem to spend a great deal of time inside the classroom on the theory side of things, but these guys get you straight out on/around the bike.My partner practiced with the scooter and I learned how to use the motorbike, simultaneously.She said she felt safe and comfortable with her instructor and felt confident enough to take it to the streets after performing well in the car park/field. I did the same.My guide was great and very efficient. The instruction to begin with is a bit fast paced and could be confusing to some, but as long as you've drove a manual car then you would be good to go.Overall I would recommend these guys if you are in need of lessons or a refresher.Cheers",5,2021-12-10

canggu,Canggu_Scooter_Lessons,"Great instructor, Gede was so patient and helpful to teach me step-by-step all about how to drive the scooter. Most important is to learn and to understand the rules and to take is slowly. We practiced many different situations to get the confidence on the street and it really helped me.

canggu,Canggu_Scooter_Lessons,"All I can say is: I wish I booked the lesson earlier! Just three weeks ago I didn't even know how to ride a bicycle. Now I ride a scooter everyday. Imagine, I had no idea what balance was. Struggling but not for long. On first day, the instructors brought me a bicycle to start with. To have the understanding of balance. After 20 minutes we tried the scooter right away. It took 6 times lessons in total. The last 2 lessons we did it on the road.The instructors gave not only good instructions about how to ride, but also safety on the road and most importantly gave you confidence too. Thank you so much Krisna and Gede!For anyone who wants to learn motorbike or just want to gain confidence on the road, give it a go!It is value for money too. I highly recommend it👌👍",5,2020-07-11

canggu,Therapy_Canggu,"My partner and I went here for a random spa day and were more than pleasantly surprised. The workers all seem very friendly and professional, and the spa itself was beautiful, clean, and tranquil. I got the Seafarer Facial, which was a quick but lovely treatment that left my face feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. I also got the Luxe Pedicure-- overall it was very good but on the menu it says 60-75 minutes, but if I saw the clock correctly my pedi was barely an hour total. Regardless, we had an amazing experience and have already booked in another day there.",4,2020-03-01
canggu,Therapy_Canggu,"While there are many options for spa services in Canggu, I believe this place is the BEST.  I got a spa package to treat myself for Valentine's day and I could not have been happier with my entire experience.  It was extremely easy to book on what's app, and the response was immediate and very friendly.  You get a cool towel and lovely drink upon arrival and I was greeted by a lovely staff.  My massage therapist (who also did my facial and reflexology, was  AMAZING.  I am a Chiropractor so perform and receive a lot of bodywork and can tell you with confidence that it was the best massage I've ever received.  I had massages in both UBUD and Sanur and this one was hands down the absolute best.  The facial was so relaxing and the reflexology was top notch.  I am typically very ticklish but she was an expert and I felt nothing but bliss.  This place has earned their name and if you want a wonderful spa experience, come to THERAPY!",5,2020-02-25

canggu,Therapy_Canggu,"I was personally underwhelmed for my visit, but it was the only time I've been.  I didn't love my first masseuse so asked for another; the second was good but not great.  I wasn't in love with the music, so asked them to turn down, but they turned it off instead, so I ended up hearing all the noise from the common areas for the duration of the massage.  In general I just didn't enjoy myself.  The facility is fine - clean, etc. - but I've had much more enjoyable massages in more spacious places elsewhere.",4,2020-02-03

canggu,CrossFit_Wanderlust,"At 250,000 rupiah for a day this place ranks way below other CrossFit style gyms I've been to around Bali. The facilities are very decent, but the class was nothing special. If this cost around 150,000 I would've given it 4-5 stars.",3,2020-02-16

Best desicion in this whole trip as the 3 hours spa session included a foot massage, full body massage, scrub, flower petal bath, facial and a head massage! It was super comfortable and relaxing for us after a long morning to Bali! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who would want to relax and have a fresh start for your Bali getaway! A short massage session in between your holiday in Bali here is great too!",5,2020-03-10
canggu,Tonic_Day_Spa_and_Botanicals,Tonic is by far my favorite spa in Bali! Their attention to detail is what makes it stand out. The decor and atmosphere are incredible. The rooms are so clean and comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming and the massages are by far the best I’ve ever had AND it’s a great price! I go at least once a week for a full body herbal massage and now I just treated myself to a Balinese Royal Spa Treatment with my boyfriend! MUST GO TO in Bali!,5,2020-02-02

jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,This was a stop over coming from ululatu temple and going back to the hotel. The beach is nice and clean. There are plenty of People around in the early evening. There are some good sea food restaurants nearby.,5,2020-05-07
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,"Firstly “ Rock bar “....as always gorgeous ( if even expensive then normal 😤)... then for balance ; our driver is a local & recommended a great restaurant on beach ; sadly don’t remember name. lt certainly was no frills but the food was fabulous & fresh, great to eat like a local.Sadlydue to current situation we were only people on beach & in restaurants area so no performance on beach .....let’s hope the world sees some normalcy soon. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4,2020-04-02
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,Needle seen on beach when my partner and I were walking on the beach barefooted. It wasn’t capped. It was an open needle amongst a load of trash on the beach. Filthy. And there were a lot of kids and beach joggers. Do not recommend.  Beach is also infested with swarms of blood-sucking sandflies and mosquitoes. Avoid at all costs. Seafood by the beach was also not great.However the pool at THE INTERCONTINENTAL is temp controlled and fantastic. It has sunset views. Also the Italian restaurant there was so good that we went again. I usually go for local food on vacation but this was exceptional.,1,2020-03-24
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,Jimbaran beach is very nice beach and have many restaurabt of seafood with delicious taste and memorable places.,5,2020-03-06
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,It's a beautiful beach. Watching the sunset was amazing. If you want seafood then that's where you should go. We went there on Christmas Day. The vibe was amazing. The food was lovely. So romantic for couples. It's a must visit if you in Bali.,4,2020-02-20
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,"Beach is bang on average for a touristy beach in Bali. Littered with rubbish and many beach front restaurants severing pitiful food. Amid the hustlers trying to sell you the same shell bracelets, and the midgets nipping at the soft flesh around your ankles, (bugs not people). The beach is just there, there was one redeeming quality that my eyes stumbled upon. An awesome giant pig (Sau) floating out in the ocean. I watched from the water as the pig rode the waves into shore far better than I could hope to do on a surfboard. Eventually the bloated behemoth rolled up the beach due to a push from a strong wave, we looked on in awe as dogs began to appear from nowhere and sniff the carcass out. At that point we decided to flee the terror inducing smell that began wafting from the sorry animal, our escape was swift. We washed our bodies in the chlorinated pool. And that was that.",2,2020-02-19

jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,"We were not impressed,the beach was very dirty,according to the local people it gets a lot of rubbish washed up after a storm,you couldn’t go into the water because you you would be wading through plastic and paper.It was extremely quiet,we stopped to have a drink at a beach bar and it was dead,thankfully we were only here for a couple of hours.",2,2020-02-08
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,Wonderful Sunset view from seafood restaurants along the bay.Good place for couples and families. White soft sands with cooling breeze blowing gently across your face.Lovely evening sunset leaving Jimbaran bay in an orange hue. Very nice place to relax.,5,2020-01-26
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,"A nice place for a fresh seafood dinner on the beach, but please watch out for the horrible taxi mafia thugs who control this area and ruined our otherwise wonderful last night in Bali.If you are anywhere within a 5 minute walk (approx) of the bay and try and order a taxi from any other company (GoJek etc) the Taxi Mafia they will chase you down to harass you and your taxi driver without warning.We ordered a GoJek to avoid the normal scams we have faced many times in tourist areas (fare changes, no change). We were hunted down twice and forced out of our taxis both times by groups of angry thugs.The Jimbaran taxi mafia couldn’t care less about our baby, who after this ordeal was in tears and screaming. Please enjoy some pics of the aggressive and heartless taxi thugs who try and extort tourists in this area.Bali is a wonderful place to visit, but the country seriously needs to solve its “taxi wars”. The otherwise positive experiences of tourists can be quickly ruined by such problems & aggressive behaviour.P.s. It’s not about the money. We tip our drivers exorbitantly. We are travelling with a young child and we prefer the security of booking online, tracking the drivers arrival, having a fixed price & being able to tip generously on our own accord.P.p.s. Thank you to our GoJek driver who went above and beyond to get us home. He was an example of the true Balinese hospitality we have experienced 99% of the time in this country.",1,2020-01-09

jimbaran,Jimbaran_Bay,"If you plan to visit Bali for a nice beach experience, then just dont. Go to Lombok or elsewhere. We stayed 2 weeks at Jimbaran bay Beach resort and spa, which is an excellent hotel, but the Jimbaran beach is like all beaches we have seen in Bali, dirty and disgusting. Deach fishes, plastic waste and all kinds of dirt is in the water and at the beach. It will ruin your experience. Your money is spend better in Lombok or Gili Islands or elsewhere. Traffic is also really a bummer...will not come again to Bali. People are friendly, but it is simply too dirty and overcrowded. It mad us kind of sad....",1,2020-01-02
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"Jimbaran was a great and super ""cheap"" experience.It only took us 20' by car from Kuta beach to reach Jimbaran fish market. The market itself is a standard indonesian fish market so do not expect any fancy booths but it offers a huge choice of all kinds of fish and sea food. However the coolest thing about Jimbaran fish market is that just close to it you have the possibility to get your stuff cooked or grilled for a very fair price of 20 000 Rp/Kg. Rice will also be served with garlic or spicy sauce Sambal. We had 1Kg of fresh shrimps ready to eat within 10'. Next time we will also choose our ""grill  operator"" for a better view on the beach and traditional fishing boats ...",5,2021-05-27
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"Just the experience of watching my sons expressions on his face, the variety of the fish and the size of some, what a great place to visit and is actually away from the tourist attractions, the boat unloading there catch was quite exciting",5,2020-06-27
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,Gorgeous beach and views. Not the golden sands of Australia but plenty to see ....like a Shetland pony on the beach!We wanted to join the fun and buy fresh seafood from the market and have it cooked to order (minimal cost to have cooked) but the sight (& smell) of the many many rows of market stalls with seafood sitting in tubs of tepid water led us back along the beachfront to a restaurant where we selected some fresh fish which had been resting on ice. It was cooked perfectly in garlic and chilli & washed down of course with Bintang!.Get to thee Market early if you wish to purchase fresh fish!,4,2020-03-02
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"We were staying in Jimbaran and cycled down to the markets early in the morning, we saw the fish coming of the boats Smelly - YesFlies - we did not see many early in the morningInteresting - DefinitelyI would not trip here unless you are staying in Jimbaran, they obviously supply all the restaurants from this fish market.",4,2020-02-01
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,We asked to be dropped off at this end of the beach to have a look at the market & decide if to eat there. 5 mins in the actually market was enough due to the strong smell. It was interesting to see the different types of fish & the hive of activity.You can pick your own fish & have it bbq'd at one of the stalls & eat there.,4,2020-01-30
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"We were recommended this place by two locals and lots of online rave reviews. ZERO idea why anyone would recommend this place. Its a real local fish market and interesting to see, for about 3 mins. After that good luck finding a decent place to eat with raw fish in the heat. Wasn't my cup of tea.Also be weary of the taxi's. we took a metered taxi from Seminyak to here for less than $100k rupiah and after we ate at an overly prices restaurant, we couldn't catch another meter taxi and even the security guard at the restaurant tried to force us nicely to get a taxi for 180k for a shorter ride to Kuta.We haggled them down to 100k for the rideI wouldn't bother wasting time here while i'm in Bali.",2,2020-01-29
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"We have been several times to the markets and several of the restaurants along the beach.I’m not sure which is the best way to go,it’s all pretty much the same and as good.But,after all the visits I have never seen a fishing boat putting to sea at Jimbaran.I have noticed though a lot of taped up polystyrene boxes being delivered by truck or scooter so I wonder where the seafood actually comes from.Does anyone know?",4,2020-01-17
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Fish_Market,We went for a look early in the morning. Despite the rain we enjoyed having a look. Good for the kids to see how other countries run their markets. Worth a visit if your local to the area. However the beach is nice so worth a day trip if your planning a lazy day on the beach.,4,2020-01-11

Fantastic outlook near the airport and Ulluwatu  hills... BUT.,4,2020-06-07

jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"If you would like to have a dinner for your body and soul, this is the place. The place is reasonable, it would not hurt you and the taste would not dissapointed you as well. At the end, you could smile and laugh, hands to hands with your partner walked along enjoying the beach and its silver colored waves.",5,2020-05-08
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"On this beach are a few  famous five star resorts located. Wide open sand beach, with some average waves. Nice but in some areas already polluted. Nice is to stay at the sunset bar at Intercontinetal with stunning views of sunset. Airport is just few km nearby, a lot of planes flying in and out.",4,2020-03-06
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"Jimbaran honestly broke my heart. The beach is full of trash, Bali is starting to become a dumping ground. The world needs to help Indonesia, we are loosing so many animals and the environment is slowly disappearing.",1,2020-03-02
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,Terrible. The beach was full of washed up rubbish with sun-loungers in the midst of the trash. Extremely disappointing,1,2020-02-29
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"Not really sure why, but the beach was disappointing. There was quite a lot of plastic and the beach wasn't cleaned. Would go here again.",2,2020-02-20
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"We enjoyed this beach and the see food was really good, planning to go again .. sunset from there is amazing",5,2020-02-14
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,I visit it in a day with waves so it was a little dirty with brown colour and too many plastics outside.Also it was February normally it's the rainy season.,2,2020-02-13
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"One of the best beaches in Bali, clean with warm shallow waters.Very quiet apart from early evening when all the bus tours drop their group off to see the sunset!",5,2020-02-12
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,Jimbaran Beach is to be one of the better and cleaner beaches in Bali - not manicured and not overly polluted with tourists. I just love it here!,5,2020-02-02
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,Jimbaran Beach is one of the best place to view and enjoy the sunset in Bali.You can see the Sun slowly meet the sea horizon while you order a drink at the many restaurants and cafes located along Jimbaran.,5,2020-01-31
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"Very crowded in the evening. Not the cleanest. Locals playing football, stretch of touristy seafood restaurants, local stalls selling corn and touristy items. You pay IDR100,000 for 2 chairs and umbrella. Not a relaxing beach definitely.",3,2020-01-27
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"This beach looked beautiful and after reading reviews on Google, my wife and I decided to stay by this beach for a night before heading to the airport the next day.We got there and stopped at a nearby restaurant (warung) for a bite and we got a cabana and a drink.  It was super hot as expected and we were excited to get in the water, this is where the disappointment set in...as we walked down to the water the beach was absolutely littered with trash.  We walked by it and got in the water and the plastic and trash in the water was literally everywhere, it was so disgusting that people could do this to such a beautiful beach. We stayed a few hours and dipped a couple more times to cool off, but left feeling grossed out from being in that water.  I'm sorry to write a review like this, but I really hope Bali can clean up it's beaches, because this one we will not be visiting again.",2,2020-01-26
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"We went to watch the sunset and were VERY shocked to see the sheer amount of plastic washed up on the shore. You'd think that the restaurants would clean the beach as their livelihoods depend on it.Quite appalling really see the pics.The plastic was far worse on the right hand side than the left (looking out to sea), in fact quite a lot worse.",5,2020-01-21
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"This beach was in walking distance of our villa and it’s so beautiful on the tourist side. Clean and well maintained. Low tide is very pretty in the morning and evening with lots of good restaurants on the beach to go to for Happy Hour and meals. The only thing I wish was different was the rocks and shells in the water that makes going swimming a bit difficult and dangerous. It’s hidden by the waves during high tide making it harder to navigate than during low tide for walks. Other than that, very nice!",3,2020-01-20
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"The Sunset is very beautiful, clean and there's a lot of good people.Suitable for those who want to do a sunbathing",4,2020-01-15
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,Travellers go for the sunrise...think that's all that its got going for it as if you take a walk from one end to the other you will see the rubbish that is washed up that spoils it.,1,2020-01-13
jimbaran,Jimbaran_Beach,"A quiet safe beach where beautiful sunset in good weather, the calm beach great for walking and jogging where near and clean without hawkers. A highly recommended beach in western Bali.",4,2020-01-11

jimbaran,Pura_Ulun_Siwi,"It was my great experience witness such a spectacular scene with my family. Initially, I was expected to visit Uluwatu's template in my planned journey, I'm so impressed and thankful that I view the big Indian Ocean on top of the cliff, so near and so close to me..",5,2020-01-20
jimbaran,Sidewalk_Jimbaran_Mall,"Very local to us, so I pop in fairly frequently.Sushi Tei is great - good food and value. Cinema nice and new although they don’t serve coffee and won’t let you take in one from other shops in the mall.J-Co is okay for coffee even if the service is ridiculously slow.My main issue here is WiFi. I can’t get on it as it requires Facebook or Instagram: which I don’t have. Thought I’d email them to see if another route to use it.I’d like to sit in the main cafe and spend money!I’ve tried (email and phone) maybe six times and not once had an answer. Never pick the phone up and emails go unanswered. In this day and age how can you turn off willing paying customers by not providing free wifi?",3,2021-05-06
jimbaran,Sidewalk_Jimbaran_Mall,"Sidewalk is a small but convenient mall in Jimbaran area (near UNUD off to Uluwatu). The Gourmet market has variety of good quality groceries (cheese, wine, meat, fish, etc). They have a restaurant inside the supermarket that serve International cuisine (wrap, porridge, couscous, burger, salad, etc). There is a bar as well in it. A cinema is located in the 2nd floor (close during this pandemic though). Other than the Gourmet Super Market by Pepito, they also have J-Co, Bakso Theresia, ShuShi Tei, Chinese Restaurant, Korean Restaurant, etc.  It's a small mall but very convenient!",4,2021-01-11
jimbaran,Sidewalk_Jimbaran_Mall,"This small mall is my favourite places  to go for lunch whenever I'm in the area. Plenty option to choose at Gourmet Market by Pepito,  couscous, salad, sandwhich, nasi goreng, and others. Green smoothies with less sugar was perfect.",4,2021-01-04
jimbaran,Sidewalk_Jimbaran_Mall,"Today our helmets were stolen by security of sidewalk because we parked our bikes in a wrong place. Workers from the nearest restaurant told us that were security guys who stole our helmets. So we came to ask then again, they were shouting at us ant talked in a very rude way! Ok guys we parked our bikes in a bad way, but we came to sidewalk to have a dinner, we are still your clients and brought you money! Is it a good attitude? It was raining and late evening I could imagine how bad could it be to come back to Cangu with lout helmet!!! I’m so disappointed! Very bad job",1,2020-05-26
jimbaran,Sidewalk_Jimbaran_Mall,a fun place to shop and there is a cinema to watch favorite movies and also a pretty comfortable place to date,4,2020-03-09

jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,"We have used Wayan twice as our driver now - once to pick us up from the airport, and also to drive us to Ubud. Both times he has been great at communicating (always quick replies on WhatsApp!), arrived on time & been really helpful. Also a really nice guy & we will continue to use & recommend him! :)",5,2021-05-25
jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,"Wayan is incredibly trustworthy, polite and helpful. Excellent communication (through whatsapp, the main way to communicate on Bali). He had send a message to confirm pick up the day before our arrival (and all other occasions) and was waiting for us at the exact meeting point at the airport, something that can be a bit overwhelming with all the drivers awaiting their passengers. If you lost your luggage, go find him first and he can assist and translate, this is much quicker then trying do it yourself. He also can provide the sim cards for you and the price is cheaper then at the airport. We booked 2 tours with him, a tailored private tour including Wild water rafting (a must do!), Lowak Coffee tasting (and Instagram photo swing over the jungle) & the Elephant Cave. The second tour was also private tailored as we first went snorkelling in the Blue Lagoon (so many fish) a local lunch and the transfer to Ubud from Seminyak. He is a save driver, always on time, with a spot clean van and shares lots of information about traditions and culture. I highly recommend Wayan or his company!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",5,2020-03-11
jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,I went to Ubud with a different driver . I lost contact with the guy and Wayan helped me find my driver with he's own phone without asking me for a penny.

jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,"We were very happy to have Wayan, we experienced that many taxidrivers try to cheat on the price and the information they give.

jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,"First off, I've not only used Wayan multiple times when visiting Bali, but I've also recommended him to friends who travel there. I have never had (or heard of) any bad experiences when using his services. He is willing to bend over backwards for his customers to ensure they have a fun, safe, and unforgettable journey in Bali. He is the sweetest and has lots of enticing facts that you will appreciate. He always comes prepared and if things don't go as planned, he easily adapts to the situation no matter how out of the way he has to go. Always such a pleasure spending the day with him. Highly recommend his services so you can have a wonderful journey in Bali too. I will be seeing you again Wayan :)",5,2020-01-26
jimbaran,Bali_Explore_Tour,Wayan is a champion. He communicates well in English and is 100% reliable.

jimbaran,Priority_Stand_Up_Paddle_Bali,My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. They picked us up from our hotel on Sunset road in Seminyak and took us back afterwards. Chris was a patient and thoughtful teacher with a nervous first time paddleboarder. The water was gentle and warm. It was fun to see the big statue in Uluwatu on the other side of the bay and watch airplanes take off from the (sort of nearby?) airport. Then end our visit with a beer on recliners in the sand.

legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,DMZ art museum is such a fun place to visit in Bali. We really had a lot of laughters here with the 3D thing. So amazing,5,2020-04-12
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"First time visit this museum , when inside the museum was not really interesting actually .Some of picture inside so average and the big problem is some staff look busy with their phone",2,2020-03-18
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,We absolutely loved DMZ!! It was sooooo much fun! The workers there knew exactly how to take each picture and they guided us on how to pose. The pictures all look amazing!! Something to cherish forever! Everything was well organized and well maintained! Definitely worth a visit 😊,5,2020-03-09
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"Great shorter activity for a family or people without children also, you just go round to each room and pose for pictures very fun and great artwork to be seen",4,2020-03-08
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,What a great way to kill and hour or so before heading to the airport.  A great idea for a rainy day too.Lots of great murals to explore and loads of fun taking photos. There are staff member in every room to help you stand correctly and to take the photos for you.,4,2020-03-07
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,It was fun to put yourself in 3D painted images and take photos. Some of them turned out hilarious. The staff there are helpful in making sure you get the right photo shot. Good to do on a rainy afternoon and it is airconditioned too.,4,2020-03-03
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"Good for something different to do, photos look good.Staff were very helpful taking photos. A bit expensive",3,2020-02-18
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,It’s good for a rainy day or bit of fun for the kids. Looks dodgey from the outside. Prepare to take many photos. Some are quite realistic. If you need a day inside or out of the rain or the kids need a few hours of entertainment. Give it a try.,4,2020-02-17
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"Most of the pictures are not good for 3d, this place can be better and the idea is good but poor application",1,2020-02-14
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,This place was ok. The pics don't look that great. Some of the staff were so grumpy but then there were few who were so helpful and loved to help us with poses and perfect photo experience. In all a one time visit place only.,3,2020-02-03
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"Great for kids and big kids also. They have a lot of rooms with a lot of images that look like flat paintings until you see the photos. You can get some really good effects. The staff are helpful and advise you where/how to stand and where to put your hands for the best photo. You don’t get time to look at your photos and adjust your poses because there are always people coming behind you, so you have to move on. It’s best to get there early before the crowds.",4,2020-02-02
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"While the 3D images were great, being followed the whole time by staff definitely made us feel uncomfortable. So much so that we left without taking photos with all the paintings, because we felt it was intrusive having people in our faces the entire time.",3,2020-01-21
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"We went here towards the end of our holiday and we were just chilling out, took a taxi from our hotel. The outside does not look impressive, but inside it is good. You have to remove your shoes, if I knew I would have brought socks. It is not dirty, I am just not used to walking barefoot, which you need for this so you do not destroy the art works. They have sample poses and they also have very helpful staff who can show you how to pose and also take the photos for you. I recommend going early to avoid the crowds so you have enough time to get good photos. We were lucky we went there when most people have gone back to work.",4,2020-01-13

legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"If you’re looking for a great family fun experience, check this place out! My partner and I went and enjoyed seeing the optical illusion art and took many photos. It was only about $22 AUD for both of us. It was nice to escape the weather for the day! Also, on another note, just up is Burger King - hear me out - while I wouldn’t usually go get fast food on a holiday (much prefer to try local food), it is great to see that many of their staff are people who people with hearing impairments and can communicate with sign language. I was more than happy to go there.",5,2020-01-05
legian,DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,We had been to Bali many times but never visited the 3d museum. That was until our last visit. When we walked in we were approached by one off the staff who helped us by placing us in the best positions on the artwork and then taking the photos for us. It wasn't until we actually sat and looked through all the photos we took we realised just how awesome each pic was. Definitely worth a visit whilst in Bali :),4,2020-01-02

legian,Legian_Beach,"Comfortable. This beach has seen tourists for decades, and it shows. Plenty of beanbags to sit on and umbrellas to sit under, with coolers full of beers and other beverages to sip. Close to Double Six hotel, the sunsets here are sublime. Stay for the day, try a surf lesson or two and watch the sun sink beyond the waves.",4,2020-11-16
legian,Legian_Beach,"Legian beach is a great beach for a swim, surf, long walk or run. You can also get a massage, pedicure souvenirs or anything you desire, It’s a bit quiet through the day at the moment due to COVID but nights are busy with locals. You can always get a cold beer, great sunset and almost any type of food you’re after. Lots of sun lounges and umbrellas for rent all day. Really good beach scene to see.",5,2020-08-12
legian,Legian_Beach,The beach is quite nice. As you can imagine sunset is an even busier time as it's very popular to sit on the beach with a drink as the sun sets.,4,2020-07-17
legian,Legian_Beach,"Previously I stayed in Legian so used the beach often, even did a surfing lesson there.This time I just did a visit. It was crowded, but not as hectic is Kita beach.The water was relatively clean as was the beach.It was nice to watch the surfers.",4,2020-06-30
legian,Legian_Beach,Go to the beach at 6 pm every night to watch the sun sink into the sea.Beach touts will be there so take your own drinks.,5,2020-06-19

legian,Legian_Beach,"Good beach, cleaner than Kuta beach. Only went in the late afternoon to see the sunset. Locals are nice on the beach and good prices on drinks too",4,2020-03-16
legian,Legian_Beach,Beautiful beach but the only thing we disliked was the plastic so it would be better if they cleaned that up. It's nice to have drinks though,4,2020-03-15
legian,Legian_Beach,"Legian beach is situated between Kuta and Seminyak. Surf beach. Plenty of deck chairs and umbrellas to hire and drinks can be purchased on the beach.On days the water can be heavily polluted with plastics. Still it’s okay for a swim, have a surf and lie on the beach. Great place to have sit in a bean chair have a beer and watch the sun set",3,2020-03-11
legian,Legian_Beach,The best best beachbar is by Ella & Dutt. Cold bintang beer. Very kindly people Ella and Dutt.After a beach walk by Ella a footmassage and a cold bintang beer.,5,2020-03-05
legian,Legian_Beach,"The beach and sunset was absolutely amazing. There are a lot of people on the beach selling drinks and with lounge chairs . You will get harassed by some salespeople wanting to sell watches, hats, massages and anything you can think of. Part of the charm of Bali if you don't let it bother you too much. The only negative thing was the beach was FULL of trash. I mean for miles as far as you could see. And not by patrons. You could tell it has all washed up from the ocean. Sad, but really not Bali's fault. It's coming from elsewhere.",3,2020-03-04
legian,Legian_Beach,"Relax on the beach, hire a Lounge, buy a drink, you will be approached by sellers so expect it, I was disappointed and concerned by the amount of plastic rubbish washed up on the Beach at low tide.",3,2020-03-02
legian,Legian_Beach,"This beach is much more relaxed and cleaner than other beaches around. In my opinion not great for for families with children. Too many haglers trying to sell useless stuff for absurd amount of money. Waves were a bit strong, I don't recommend for casual swim, maybe for surfers it would be more suitable.",4,2020-03-01
legian,Legian_Beach,"Filthy, unattractive and not worth even a look. Plenty of other beaches in Bali to visit, and I certainly wouldn't swim here!",2,2020-03-01
legian,Legian_Beach,"Coming from teh Gold Coast we have the BEST Beaches , disapointing to see the beaches in such a state, need to use the beach cleaning equipment we use here for our beaches",3,2020-02-25
legian,Legian_Beach,We sat here and watched a glorious sunset had a drink and relaxed beach was a bit dirty but I think that it's because of rainy season negotiations over seats on the beach need to be done before sitting be careful,4,2020-02-24
legian,Legian_Beach,"Came here early 2019 and it seemed okay, returned this year and the beach is way worse with a lot more vendors all the way along it and a 100 times more rubbish on the beach and in the water. No one seems to have control of anything happening on the beach and very ‘sparse’ efforts to clean it up. All of this is a shame as the town offers some great hotels, restaurants and bars and should have a great beach to go with it.",3,2020-02-18
legian,Legian_Beach,"Polluted with plastic so very disappointing. So much plastic, plastic,plastic. Dead fish. Water warm but loads of floating rubbish",1,2020-02-18

legian,Legian_Beach,"A pleasantly wide beach, accessed from the iconic gates so beloved by Instagrammers. Watch your step on the narrow and uneven sidewalks to get there. Not only do the tiles rise and fall, you also have to dodge every shop’s floral and incense offering. Upon arrival my husband and I were accosted (yet in a nice way) by a woman determined to give us massages. She would not take a polite “no” for an answer and finally left us after hearing “maybe tomorrow.”A few hours before sunset, the beach shack vendors industriously put out large bean bags to increase their chances for your consumption from them. We were watching the surf school and serendipitously ended up sitting on beanbags at “Jack Sparrow” in front of the Pullman Hotel, with a personable fellow serving up Bintangs. For dinner options there was no shortage of local warungs within a short walking distance. It was such a pleasant experience that we plan to return to this beach at the tail end of our trip.",5,2020-02-10
legian,Legian_Beach,"Our hotel was just across the road from this lovely beach and we spent lots of time on it. It has something for everyone and every time you go there you see something different.In the daytime it is great for long walks, watersports and sunbathing. Loungers are available to rent for not much money along with umbrellas.It is lined by small shops and some really good cheap restaurants selling local food. Most of the time the sea is quite calm and very safe but it can get choppy. When this happens, lots of debris is washed up which is a real shame and it’s a pity people don’t take more care of it.",4,2020-02-09

legian,Legian_Beach,I have lost count of the number of times I have been to Legian but this is the most clean I have ever seen it. The locals have worked really hard to tidy the sand and the water. Great spot to watch the sunset,5,2020-01-25

legian,Legian_Beach,"Rico, the owner, is friendly but most of all honest.  He sat and had a chat with us and we all had a few laughs.  We played our music and even had a little picnic and that wasn't a problem. The location was great for us as it wasn't far from our hotel. He even set up a tent set up for a toilet.  I think that was mainly for the guys.  I went to the one at Azul's or there is a public toilet down the way if Azul's doesn't let you use theirs.  When it was time to pay the bill he used his phone and showed us the workings out.I recommend this place to anybody.Thanks Rico",4,2020-01-11
legian,Legian_Beach,From someone who swore never to sit on the beach at Bali again .i spent nearly every night of my stay watching the sun go down at Robins bar.Not as many hawkers as used to be and they only have a small patch of ground they must stay in.So is actually very relaxing drinking icy cold buntings in a bean bag where the temp is about 15o cooler than your room across the road.Robins is directly out front of the Legian beach hotel.Lovely guy will tell you if seller not trustworthy and will keep them moving if he senses they annoying you.Thanks Robin.,5,2020-01-10

legian,Legian_Beach,"We had lazy Day at the beach and instead of renting sunbed we stayed at the local beach bar beansack chairs and kept ordering cool beverages between swimming and reading books. :) the sunset other night was nice too, little bit too crowded to enjoy it. Also the sales people walking to people to people are annoying. Good swimming and surffing beach.",4,2020-01-07
legian,Legian_Beach,"Nice beach, cleaned every morning.  Good for learning surf. Too much bars and surf schools when you enter on the beach. They are too insistent to sell you courses, drinks or sunbeds. Difficult to stay relax.",3,2020-01-05
legian,Legian_Beach,"Stayed in legian, never tried seminyak or kuta (for comparison)Positives: Beer is about $3 a bottle at most shacks which is perfect for having a few watching the sunset. Some nice bars and restaurants with lovely ambience at the beachside hotels which anyone can use, 2for1 cocktails at $12-$14 (very nice too) and your standard cheap Bintang beer for $3 or $5 for a tall bottle. Meals range from $8 for a beer/pizza or $16 for example duck, steak or lamb. Staff are usually incredibly friendly at hotels and don’t tend to try and rip you off.Negatives: Beaches are lined with rubbish, went surfing, $5 for 2 surfboards although they will try and charge you $10(1 hour) had a few plastic bags wrap around my arms and legs while surfing for 30 minutes. Beds cost around $5 each to hire with an umbrella, or as usual they will try and charge you more. Be prepared to be approached every 3 minutes by people trying to sell you bracelets, sunglasses, hats, watches ect. Good: cheap beer, nice sunsetsBad: overcharging, dirty beach/ocean, struggle to relax due to beach sellersTiger Itchy Bum Bar👌",3,2020-01-05
legian,Legian_Beach,"I had high hopes that I'd finally get to enjoy the beach in Bali, but this wasn't it. There were lots of surfing lessons being offered, but I'm not into that. The water wasn't very clear, so I waded in the water a little.",3,2020-01-03

legian,Legian_Beach,"Went here on the late afternoon of the last day of 2019 & come back again in the late evening on that day. In the afternoon, the beach was already quite crowded, but we still can walk on the white sand beach to wait for the sunset. In the late evening, it get even more crowded, with lots of fire works. It was truly a happening place for the new year countdown. We all enjoyed our time here",5,2020-01-02

legian,Garlic_Lane,A must see local shopping street. Ask for a price then come back with about a 1/3 counter offer. Be mindful that you might only be haggling over a dollar - they have to make a living as well.,4,2020-02-27
legian,Garlic_Lane,"Garlic Lane is famous in Bali, I believe because it is central, easy to get to...but more importantly, becase is sells one of everything, and has a set price shop ot the back ""Bali Kmart"" where you can brouse without being hasseled, and know what the price is. If you don't have much time to shop during your Bali trip, come here and get eveything you want in one place. Shoppers heaven. The ""Lady Boy Show"" upstairs from the restaurant is a really great night out too.",5,2020-02-18
legian,Garlic_Lane,This street is quite short but packs a lot in for sure. It can get quite busy especially late at night but always has a good atmosphere.On it you will find several really good restaurants selling authentic food at reasonable prices. These are in amongst souvenir shops of mixed quality.It isn’t pedestrianised but is still safe as long as you pay attention. There is a motorcycle taxi rank at one end which will whizz you off home for not much money if required.,5,2020-02-09

legian,Garlic_Lane,Abusive and Blue language by stall holder after price not agreed to.    The only reason 1 star as there is no option not to rate She was just foul mouthed - we didn’t agree which is fine- but she decided to abuse me in front of my 14 year old - so doesn’t deserve any business - disgraceful attitude really disappointing - interesting she had no issue using the F word - am sure they own that whole strip as she said her sister owned next stand as we were looking.  She doesn’t deserve the business.   Other stall holders do. Went to buy items from someone outside Garlic Lane instead.,1,2020-01-24

legian,Jalan_Legian,This Legian street is a pickpocket's area.They come in group in night outside Bounty Club and look for traveller's who is drunk. My suggestion if you are staying nearby Bounty club : Please don't wear any Gold reckless or Bracelet. These people are good in snatching. Don't carry mobile and purse. Keep only cash which you think is enough for a night. You will not find single Cop over there. My suggestion La favela in Seminyak is a best place for party at night. Drop the idea of partying near Bounty Club. FYI : Sky Garden is now closed.,1,2020-02-17
legian,Jalan_Legian,Fun street for a night out. We went with friends for some drinks and live music. There is an amazing Mexican restaurant at the end called Don Juan. We found it accidentally and loved it so much.,5,2020-02-13

Very seldom is it quiet and there is always something happening or something to see.There is something for everyone here. Whether it’s street food, a smart restaurant, a live music bar or shops you will find it. It gets very busy at night but, As long as you keep your wits about you, it is a great spectacle.One tip when you’re crossing the road is constantly look both ways. The normal highway code simply doesn’t apply here and everybody goes anyway they want!",5,2020-02-10
legian,Jalan_Legian,"This is the main street that runs through Legian.The street is narrow that is very busy and there are numerous shops, ATMs, money exchange places, restaurants and bars, The Ground Zero Memorial and all of the night clubs located along both sides of the street.Traffic along this straight from mid afternoon right into the knot is extremely slow and hectic with you having to watching every direction if you cross the ride as there are cars trucks motorcycles scooters old traveling often in the wrong direction and so if you don't keep a look at you could easily become a pedestrian victim.A very busy interesting street and there are also a lot of people flying to sell their bits and pieces and scam tourists.A lot of young children walking around asking for money and food and many of them just involved in scams. These young children offer to sell you little trinkets, show you card tricks or ask you to buy them food. If you buy them something like a drink or a small item I will try and get you to purchase them something which is a bit higher in price so as soon as you leave they will take it back to the store get a refund and pocket the money.Some of them a genuine but many are not and some of them are really rude if you don't buy them something they will give you a mouth full of abuse.An interesting street to sit in one of the bars and watch what goes by and what goes on",3,2020-01-30

legian,Cocoon_Medical_Spa,"I’ve visited Cocoon at their location on Jalan Monkey Forest in Ubud.  While located in a bustling part of the Ubud centre (near to all the shops, cafes and the monkey forest), the spa has a quiet, private ambience.  The entrance, waiting area and treatment rooms are clean and inviting, as well.   Calling to schedule an appointment was a breeze, thanks to their lovely receptionists.  They smiled sincerely, and greet me warmly by name.  They were proficient and efficient — ensuring that my visit flowed smoothly from entrance to exit.  Dr Ivan was excellent.  He listened attentively to my skincare preferences and concerns, explained all treatment considerations clearly and comprehensively, and answered all of my questions knowledgeably and with ease.  He was the perfect combination of professional and personable.  His assistant couldn’t have been kinder or more attentive, too.  My experience was wonderful.  Thank you, Cocoon Ubud!",5,2020-02-28

legian,Cocoon_Medical_Spa,"The facial itself was okay.just what described, nothing more nothing less. The technician was very sweet but certainly did not go above and beyond and the experience was quite mechanical. In Sydney for a similar price, if I had to sit 20 minutes with a mask on , the technician would massage your hand or something. But it was okay.The driver was also Good. The receptionists however were awful. After confirming my daughters could book for massages , upon arrival they said that this was not possible . They could not care less , they also did not try to suggest others treatments and just looked very cranky . They Definitely either need to be sacked or retrained immediately. After I finished my treatment , even though they assured me on the phone I could get a return transfer , they said that it would no longer be possible . Told me they would book a cab and I could get money out of a money changer . I had no cash and was dressed for massage facial so I toldThem i was not comfortable in a cab dressed in swimwear They  laughed when I said I was unhappy   said I could get money from the hotel . I asked if I could add more to the bill so I could get cash but they refused and laughed again When I asked why they were laughing when I was asking for help they finally stopped laughing . Would not return .",2,2020-01-04

And I've never had a bad massage here. However, my friend and I and her young daughter had a massage at a time when they were relatively busy so we were downstairs near the nail bar. It was not all that relaxing we could hear people coming and going from the front door throughout the whole hour and also the staff that did not have customers sat just outside our curtain for the duration and spoke well above their ""Library Voices"" for the whole hour.

legian,Cocoon_Medical_Spa,"I’ve visited Cocoon at their location on Jalan Monkey Forest in Ubud.  While located in a bustling part of the Ubud centre (near to all the shops, cafes and the monkey forest), the spa has a quiet, private ambience.  The entrance, waiting area and treatment rooms are clean and inviting, as well.   Calling to schedule an appointment was a breeze, thanks to their lovely receptionists.  They smiled sincerely, and greet me warmly by name.  They were proficient and efficient — ensuring that my visit flowed smoothly from entrance to exit.  Dr Ivan was excellent.  He listened attentively to my skincare preferences and concerns, explained all treatment considerations clearly and comprehensively, and answered all of my questions knowledgeably and with ease.  He was the perfect combination of professional and personable.  His assistant couldn’t have been kinder or more attentive, too.  My experience was wonderful.  Thank you, Cocoon Ubud!",5,2020-02-28

legian,Cocoon_Medical_Spa,"The facial itself was okay.just what described, nothing more nothing less. The technician was very sweet but certainly did not go above and beyond and the experience was quite mechanical. In Sydney for a similar price, if I had to sit 20 minutes with a mask on , the technician would massage your hand or something. But it was okay.The driver was also Good. The receptionists however were awful. After confirming my daughters could book for massages , upon arrival they said that this was not possible . They could not care less , they also did not try to suggest others treatments and just looked very cranky . They Definitely either need to be sacked or retrained immediately. After I finished my treatment , even though they assured me on the phone I could get a return transfer , they said that it would no longer be possible . Told me they would book a cab and I could get money out of a money changer . I had no cash and was dressed for massage facial so I toldThem i was not comfortable in a cab dressed in swimwear They  laughed when I said I was unhappy   said I could get money from the hotel . I asked if I could add more to the bill so I could get cash but they refused and laughed again When I asked why they were laughing when I was asking for help they finally stopped laughing . Would not return .",2,2020-01-04

legian,La_Karma_Spa,"We have been going to Bali for many years and this spa is always outstanding. It is clean and has a nice feel. When you have a massage upstairs is really peaceful. And I've never had a bad massage here. However, my friend and I and her young daughter had a massage at a time when they were relatively busy so we were downstairs near the nail bar. It was not all that relaxing we could hear people coming and going from the front door throughout the whole hour and also the staff that did not have customers sat just outside our curtain for the duration and spoke well above their ""Library Voices"" for the whole hour. That was a bit disappointing. Price is great though at 95,000 R.",4,2020-03-16

All three of us loved it and we left will soft and massage feet after a long day of walking. We then immediately booked in for the hot stone massage and the coconut oil massage.

So relaxing and the massage was an absolute dream.",5,2020-02-29
legian,Oasis_Spa_at_Lemongrass,On arriving at this spa the lady in reception was nice.That’s were it ended. I have been to many spas in Bali over the 20 plus years we have been coming here. The sheet was dirty apparently from cleaners. You shouldn’t of put this on the massage table then. The massage was terrible hands down just a rub of oil in body. They didn’t have any idea what to do one minute working on your head then down to your feet. We mentioned this to the owner and she couldn’t care less. I don’t like making bad reviews but this needs to be said. Maybe it was a off day but I have had a better massage on beach for a quarter of  the price. I’m not sure of other reviews here saying 5 stars but taking your money for a oil rub wasn’t on. Sorry Oasis but not up to scratch. We weren’t after a free massage if this what you were looking for but you should show more compassion if you will get more clients to come here. We won’t return and will not give recommendations to anyone else. We aren’t Aussie bogans either.,1,2020-01-27
legian,Oasis_Spa_at_Lemongrass,My favourite Spa now in Legian.Staff are professional and courteous and fantastic at reflexology and many other treatments on the menu.The salon is very clean and aesthetically appealing with a good choice of relaxation music playing during treatments.

nusa_dua,Nusa_Dua_Beach,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian. The black sand beaches up in Tabanan and Tanah Lot  are only better because there's no-one on them :)",5,2020-02-15

I could say this is a hidden gem spot, usually known for nusa dua beach instead of Geger beach.If you have visited The Mulia Resort or St. Regis Bali, then you have been to Geger beach. My feedback, geger beach is clean beach due to its location with luxury hotels and it gets cleaned up everyday. You will find many chairs for sunbathing and watersports equipment rental such as scuba diving gear, Katamaran boat, snorkeling gears and surfboards.Fewer visitors are around on the southern coast of Geger Beach, and there is sundeck with umbrellas on the beach shoreline. Sundeck and umbrella, provided by the resort, for guests who stay in the resort. Hotel guests usually order drinks at the resort bar located on the beach area. Also, near the Bar area, there is a swimming pool for resort guests. Over all, Geger beach is a good white sand beach to visit and to enjoy the beach. Enjoy!",4,2021-07-15
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,Plenty of sunbeds + umbrellas. We payed 100k per pair. Food and massage service available. Local lunch 50k IDR/ person (approx) incl. fried rice and a cold Bintang :),5,2020-11-07
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,The perfect time to go to Geger beach is for sunrise. It is so peaceful and mesmerizing sunrise!Remember to check the tides information before you go there :),5,2020-09-20
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,"This place is not well known yet. It makes it special because it has less visitors. Most of them was local people. Just need to pay IDR 5000 for the parking lot. If you don't really like beach, this place it's worth to visit.",4,2020-02-28
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,Pisma is a first class food handler and a great conversationalist if you want to chat . Maguro is usually pretty busy But if you get there early sometimes there is time to chat I really enjoyed her. JONO HODI is also a great guy And goes out of his way to make your dining experience perfect. As a matter of fact we all became friends now on Facebook and we do talk time to time.,5,2020-01-08
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,Nice view but uncomfortable too swim because of seaweed and rocks all over the tip of the beach. For laying down on top of the sand its a bit disgusting because lots of dogs roaming around eventhough with the owner. Renting a sunbed is recommended for a cozy afternoon sunbathing. Get a day pass from Mulia Hotel is also another luxury options.,4,2020-01-07
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,My other options of the beach when i am in nusa dua. Beautiful and clean beach with few choices of restaurants. Our favorite thing is laying on to tan with drinking coconut. You can see also some fishers around. Recommend place if you are around nusa dua.,5,2020-01-06
nusa_dua,Geger_Beach_Nusa_Dua_Bali,"The beach is very nice, sandy, very long for a nice walk and not too crowded even it was during the new year holiday. The sea is nice even if in the water there are many algae’s from the sea. But it is the right place for a relaxing day on the beach in Nusa Dua area outside our resort",3,2020-01-03
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Bali Collection was a beautiful and small shopping center located near our resort in the Nusa Dua area. There were many cafes and restaurants here. It was a good place to buy Indonesian souvenirs. this place is small but brilliant 😜😍,4,2021-09-18
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Lots of shops but opens at 12 noon(maybe because of covid regulations) and very quiet in october....,4,2020-11-01
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"The Bali Collection was s great bonus to staying at the Melia.It was a max 10 minute walk from our hotel room. It had everything you could need.  A great variety of restaurants, gift shops, massage and mani /medi shops. We had a few massages whole here and they were amazing. Grocery stores as well as clothing boutiques which had some nice garments. Something for everyone.",5,2020-09-29
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Great shopping area and is a lot cleaner than the shops in the street. Nice restaurants and cafes and well worth a visit if you are in Nusa Dua.,5,2020-04-09
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Very quiet but that has to be expected due to Coronavirus... I will say the one of the best stores is The Corner Store but if you are over a size 14 there is Absolutely no shopping for you at Bali Collection,3,2020-03-17
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Shops not as diverse and expensive. Supermarket was twice more expensive than any other place i went to.To top it off, shuttle bus didnt come according to the schedule on the website and taxi mafia who didnt allow Grab or Gojek wanted to charge twice the amount",2,2020-03-14
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Always visit when in Bali. Good to stock up on supplies to take back to your hotel.Some great trinkets, jewelry and clothes.Not as cheap as the markets but worth the extra to shop in comfort.",5,2020-03-12

nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"This is an open air plaza style shopping forum, with only the actual shops having A/C and being protected from the elements. ALL ITEMS SOLD ARE VIA FIXED PRICES. You can buy all the standard Bali tourist souvenirs available anywhere between Kuta to Ubud.....All be it, at slightly inflated and fixed prices.  This is not the place to buy ‘copy’/‘fake’ brand name items.  It is also NOT a factory outlet centre with the associated discounts. Everything sold here is the genuine article and current seasonal styles. The prices are the same as any retail store in Australia, e.g. Billabong board shorts @$80-$90AUD. There are definitely sales to be had.  However, once again the sale prices are the same discount/price as in Australia. Visit Bali Collection if you are ‘over’ your resort (first world problem) or you need some decent clothes to wear whilst in Bali.",3,2020-03-10
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"So yes u can find everything u need here. Since staying in Nusa Dua means its far away from everything and since your resort provides shuttle svc here, y not. Otherwise, save ur wants to other parts in baLi cos its pricey here. Everything here are more expensive than the other areas in baLi This place is huge, explore since ure there otherwise .. i recommend Bebek tepi sawah for food. The servings are huge!",3,2020-03-06

nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Awesome time at Bali Collection! Large variety of shops carrying everything from candles to clothes to eatables! Visited twice during our 7 day visit as we found the gift shops there were well worth the trip !,5,2020-03-01
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Great variety of stores. Not all trinket shops, extensive clothing, beach wear and souvenirs. Short walk from Club Med on a cement or tiled pathway along the beach foreshore. Open till 10pm which was ideal. Lots of restaurants, had a great meal , drinks and coffee at Bemo’s. Friendly staff and very reasonable prices. Fantasy coffee.",5,2020-02-29
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Why one would want to visit the mall whilst in Bali as opposed to the local shopping astounds me . They provide free pick up from surrounding hotels assume this is the only way to get the crowd in. it is fine if you like mall shopping, we visited on the way the the Bali Theater to watch Devdan",2,2020-02-28
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,The complex mainly conveys restaurants and art markets. There are a pharmacy and a convenience store but they have limited items.The complex looks old and quiet.,3,2020-02-27
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Nice choice of shops, friendly people there Nice restaurants and some live music is greatYou will spend a nice time there",4,2020-02-27
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Free shuttle was provided by Bali Collection, we took the pickup from our hotel Sofitel with 1 hour interval in the afternoon.  Shopped at Polo, mostly are those made locally.  We then took a taxi that costed USD 5 to Amarterra Villas for dinner, only to realize the hotel was just next door, within walking distance.  I did enquire a lady and a gentlemen working there at the Reception but both never mentioned the walking distance, so it was very disappointed that the staff there were not helpful.  Even the taxi driver took advantage and drove so slowly.  Next time, better do our own research before going there.",4,2020-02-22
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Just literally across the road from our hotel, Grand Hyatt. Plenty of restaurants to choose from catering for all tastes and budgets. Not undercover, so be prepared to get extremely wet when it rains, which it does often. Range of shops from gift shops to the likes of Polo, Quiksilver, Billabong, supermarket, pharmacy, optician and a Baskin Robbins ice cream shop.Polo shop have up to 70% off, so you can grab a bargain here.Recommend visiting. You could probably spend up to a couple of hours here.Comes alive at night.",5,2020-02-22
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Easy place to do some basic shopping while breaking from beach. Lot of local stuff and sports goods. Did not try yet food corners but there's a lot of them with many tastes.,4,2020-02-20
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Cool area with many different shops and restaurant. Much bigger area then we first thought. We spent hours here. Worth a visit!,4,2020-02-19
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Bali collection is in the Nusa Dua area, it’s a open area shopping complex with a lot of restaurants. Some restaurants offer pick up and drop off services to hotels in the Nusa Dua area. There’s an art market with competitive prices, best to check a few of the local shops that offer the same items to compare the prices. There are several spas offering massages and reflexology too. The only unpleasant experience is taxi vendors consistently pushing people to use their taxis at inflated prices upon exiting the complex through the west gate.",4,2020-02-19
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Good spot for mainstream and boutique shopping. You can enjoy a tasty lunch or some pampering to break up the day.,5,2020-02-17
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"We were staying across from the Bali collection at the grand Hyatt. Visited here most days. Had everything we needed. Great Resteraunts, massages, hair braiding, supermarket, chemist and market style shopping for any of the Bali souvenirs. Some things were pricey, but I really didn’t mind. The convenience was great, super clean, highly recommended!",5,2020-02-16
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Perfect service .the staff have made the vacation a perfecexperience with friendly nature and great conversation! The food is delicious at every restaurant even in the dining room .  The on-site dishes have lots of delicous dishes and very delicious afternoon tea.  Can be done with more salty foods at afternoon tea. The villa is perfect.  Maintain perfect with both cleaning services that occur at breakfast or dinner.  The pool is fantastic and the jacuzzi is fantastic.  The shower was at a great pressure and of course the automatic restroom was a nice touch.  Excellent use of all the spaces through the villas.  Extremely comfortable beds and pillows.,3,2020-02-13
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Enjoying the afternoon at Bali Collection also shopping at some place. They have SOGO inside the place.Price a bit higher than other location or market.,5,2020-02-12
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Bali Collection is a good little collection of shops, bars and restaurants in anotherwise pretty sterile area of Bali. Apart fron the beach resorts Nusa dua has little to offer tourists so Bali collection is a great addition to the area. Great selection of restaurants and good little boutique stores as well as major luxury brands. There is also a small department store. Well wort a visit!",4,2020-02-11
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"We regularly visited the Bali Collection during our stay at The Novotel. It has some really nice restaurants where we dined on several occasions. There are some really large souvenir shops with a good range of local arts and crafts.  We were there at a quiet time and so there was a fare amount of pressure to come and try different restaurants. You can try the sucking fish massage , but I found it too ticklish to sustain,!!",4,2020-02-10
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,A good collection of shops and restaurants. A good place to come if you aren’t keen on the bartering style of Bali shopping in the markets.,4,2020-02-09
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Strangely quiet. Good variety of shops in this rambling open air mall but you need a taxi, car or bus to get there. Hot humid weather on the day did not help the experience.",3,2020-02-09
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Great mallMap given by security guard gave us easy directions where to find everything needed from clothing to supermarket to restaurants to art and souvenirs at reasonable prices. No being hassled for a sale at all.Mall supposedley doesnt allow Go Jek (similar to Uber) taxi service to pick you up from mall but can order down the road..that was only downside.Otherwise great place to visit and lots of shade during the heat,5,2020-02-07
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Ate at an Italian place at the west gate. Awful food marked up at ridiculous prices. Would have been better off having dinner at my hotel.,3,2020-02-06

nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"We visited the Bali Collection several times while staying at Nusa Dua as there's a free shuttle bus there from some of the resorts. There are many restaurants and shops spanning over a long open air mall. There's security at the entrances and clean amenities. There's a pharmacy and convenience store..... Water, drinks and snacks are expensive. Catch a taxi to Hardy's Nusa Dua... Super cheap and a bigger variety.",4,2020-02-01
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Love the Shops :) wished the restaurants were equally exciting! Love the staff at cold stone creamery, they make our visits always so fun!",3,2020-01-31
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Overpriced & not really worth it! Good as a place to grab some limited groceries if you are desperate but you can get cheaper elsewhere! Little shuttles run from the hotels.,2,2020-01-30
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,We’ve been every time on our  half dozen visits to Bali always seem to end up hereIt’s got a great relaxed and secure  feel and there are plenty of shops and restaurants and it looks really good at night there’s really no alternatives to this placeMy only comment would be that the shops are a little expensive but as I said there’s not much competition apart from  haggling out on the street and we are past doing thatAs other reviewers have said you can get a free shuttle to and from and there are a number of resorts that are located within short walking distance i.e. shuttle then walk back and jump in your pool  The only thing I think is missing really are some roadside stall type operations which gave a real Bali experience that you don’t find here nowBack in 2000 this was a very special place with lots of stalls and hair braiding being done outside under the shade of a tree And it was a great experienceAs I said earlier if you’re visiting this area you really need to visit and you won’t be disappointed except perhaps on some of the prices but the convenience and relaxed atmosphere always make it worthwhile for us,4,2020-01-29
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,Good shops. All international brands. But expensive. Even bottled water is expensive here as compared to other areas. But offers going on at least as of now. Lot of restaurants.. All good,5,2020-01-25

nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Regularly visited Bali collection for shopping, dinner, massages and decadent salon experiences. A cheaper alternative than the resorts and good quality;",4,2020-01-20
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"Too many hard surfaces, too little shade and the products for sale were repetitive. The handicrafts were overpriced and there was very little choice. The restaurants were bland and could have been anywhere in the world. Not our style at all.For those looking for supermarket items the Coco was more expensive than any other supermarket - including Coco supermarkets in Nusa Dua.",2,2020-01-18
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,This shopping and eating precinct is in the resort complex at Nusa Dua. We visited to go to the cocos supermarket and restock on essentials. There is a myriad of upmarket shops and restaurants presented in a very nice walk through mall. Of course expect to pay a bit more in a resort precinct such as this!,3,2020-01-18
nusa_dua,Bali_Collection,"We visited this several time while we stayed in the Nusa Dua area. It is a good alternative to hotel restaurants and shops. However, expect it to be overrated as well due to its main focus being turists.You may find some imported articles in their shops too if looking for something in particular from abroad.",3,2020-01-17

nusa_dua,Water_Blow,"At the time of visit, entrance was free but they had constructed an admission office so I presume they were going to introduce a charge in the future.I used to go in the morning after breakfast, walk off the buffet breakfast. We also went later in the afternoon and at both times the tide was high.This is a rocky cliff where the ocean waves hit and blows over to the crowd.Some patience is required as the waves build up as a crescendo. You also need patience to get a good spot to take pictures and we did move around a bit to see the waves from different viewpoints.",5,2020-04-29
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,"Crystal clear water, can see heaps of fish, whales, turtles. Only roped off so need to take care. Uneven ground to walk on. Well worth the trip.  fantastic guide, knowledgeable of the area and history. Need the full day to explore, swim and snorkel.",5,2020-03-07
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,I gave it a 1 star only because the tide was low and I was so very saddened and disappointed because I didn't get any high water blow 🥺😢,1,2020-03-07
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,We visited close to full tide and the scene was very good. The huge gasp from the spectators when the blow happened summaries the scene,5,2020-02-28
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,"Indeed an interesting experience. Have never seen anything like this, the waves get very strong and a must go place when in Bali.",5,2020-02-25
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,"The waves were not big so not much of a blow. The walk to the point is pleasant and easy with lots of both fish and boat activity in very clear water. Admission is free . If on a long beach walk, a worthwhile and pleasant stop.",4,2020-02-19
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,"Fortunately, the day we visited here it was free entrance due to ongoing construction works. Had I have had to pay the entrance fee I may have felt a little ripped off as there is nothing more than a few rocks blowing water spray through holes and gaps in the rocks. The blows are good enough to keep you entertained for a few minutes but not something I would want to pay to see. The walk to the blowholes itself is pleasant enough but very short and again not worth the entrance fee had I paid it.",2,2020-02-11
nusa_dua,Water_Blow,My only tip is that you go when there’s high tide. When there’s low tide everything looks bare but the view is still beautiful. We didn’t pay entrance fee as well.,3,2020-02-09

nusa_dua,Puja_Mandala,"If you're in the area, it's worth making a short stop here, 5 religions with their place of worship all side by side, surely symbolizes unity and tolerance (though in practice a bit lacking in Indonesia as one certain religion tends to dominate and bully the others, unfortunately)No entrance fee here, but respectful clothing needed, don't come in your beachwear!",4,2020-01-17

nusa_dua,The_Bay_Bali,A day trip to this beautiful place is a must. Lots of vast garden areas to just sit and relax. Beautiful statues add to the ambiance of the place. Another entrance takes you to a small beach area. Good enough for photos only. Lots of small jagged rocks reminds of the same rock in a place called hell in the Cayman Islands. Art gallery and  tourist shops as well as restaurants. Great shopping at Sogo,5,2020-02-13
nusa_dua,The_Bay_Bali,Although The Bay is still operating - couple of restaurants and bars - surf and turf has gone. It says they are creating something new but it didn’t look like much was happening.,1,2020-01-25
nusa_dua,The_Bay_Bali,This place looks nothing like the reviews and photographs as it was probably in its peak in the 2017 period and now appears in declineAlthough being far over rated we found the walk between the two headlands and in front of the fantastic hotels to be enjoyable and the beach appeared very clean and user friendly. Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk. Worth a visit if you’re bored and don’t want to leave Nusa Dua,4,2020-01-23
nusa_dua,Peninsula_Island,I used to walk it to Peninsula Island from my hotel in Nusa Dua.They had the Garden of Hope Peninsula which you could walk about.You could go to the Water Blow.As we went in the summer they had the Nusa Dua light festival which was a paid event.You could always see the lighted displays from a distance and there were a lot of food karts about for the festival.,4,2020-04-23

nusa_dua,The_Bay_Bali,Although The Bay is still operating - couple of restaurants and bars - surf and turf has gone. It says they are creating something new but it didn’t look like much was happening.,1,2020-01-25
nusa_dua,The_Bay_Bali,This place looks nothing like the reviews and photographs as it was probably in its peak in the 2017 period and now appears in declineAlthough being far over rated we found the walk between the two headlands and in front of the fantastic hotels to be enjoyable and the beach appeared very clean and user friendly. Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk. Worth a visit if you’re bored and don’t want to leave Nusa Dua,4,2020-01-23
nusa_dua,Peninsula_Island,I used to walk it to Peninsula Island from my hotel in Nusa Dua.They had the Garden of Hope Peninsula which you could walk about.You could go to the Water Blow.As we went in the summer they had the Nusa Dua light festival which was a paid event.You could always see the lighted displays from a distance and there were a lot of food karts about for the festival.,4,2020-04-23
nusa_dua,Peninsula_Island,"When you walk across peninsula island it is not obvious it was an island . 2 fabulous statues tower over you . Walk on to see the water blow area, black volcanic rock.

If you are a couple or more people, ask them for a free transfer, probably they will arrange for you a pick-up and drop-back. IMHO this spa is the best independent local spa in the Nusa Dua area. It offers a great service with amazing prices and also a green setting. I've been going to this spa for a couple of years now and always come out feeling so relaxed and refreshed.

nusa_dua,Nusa_Bali_Spa,"I’ve been coming to Nusa Bali Spa for two years, on several visits to Bali. The spa is air-conditioned and spotlessly clean. Every time I go, whether solo or with friends, I am greeted warmly. Service is very professional, and the value is good. This time I was alone and, after a grueling series of flights from the U.S. and layovers, I decided on my first full day in Bali to treat myself to a 90-minute massage...without oil, which just makes me hotter in this hot & humid climate. I had an excellent treatment in a relaxed environment, with calming Balinese music in the background. I’ll be back again soon, and when my friends arrive in a couple of weeks, I’ll be bringing them too.",5,2020-01-19
nusa_dua,TSL_The_Shampoo_Lounge_Nusa_Dua,"Wow- what an experience.  This place rocks.  The shop has been open for maybe a year.  Everything is new, very clean, hip and sharply decorated.  Feels like you have stepped into a fancy day spa in the states or any western country.All the staff are super friendly and for the most part speak excellent english.  Their range of services is vast and extensive for both men and women.  They have designed it to have a traditional men's barbershop on one side of the building and a fancier ladies salon on the other side of the building.Check out their website for a glimpse of their offerings.  If you don't see a service you are looking for, simply call or whattsapp them to ask if they can perform whatever you desire and chances are they will be able to arrange it.I go regularly for a mens' clip and cut.  If you connect with a specific barber, find out his work schedule and make a request for him when you book an appointment.  Speaking of appointments, I highly suggest calling ahead to do so, as on the weekends and even weekdays they can sometimes be empty and other days be slammed.The mens haricut rocks.  Starts out with a fantastic head massage/hariwash, followed by the cut of your choosing.  There is a huge board with suggested styles (all with a specific number to order by) you can check out while getting your wash.  Then afterwards order your haircut by number off of the board, or simply tell the barber if something specific and let them do the rest.  After your cut, back to the shampoo station you go to wash out all the short clipped hair and another scalp massage.  Finally back to the chair for any final touch ups, a fantastic neck/shoulder massage and style.  You would easily pay over $50+ UDS in a major city for a haircut experience like this.  At the Shampoo Lounge  it will be just a fraction of that price.  They are constantly offering special deals so call ahead and plan your visit accordingly.The Manager (Christina) is a gem.  She runs the place as if it is her personal mission to make every guest feel right at home.  Tell her Nathan sent you and she will take great care of you!And the best part of your Shampoo Lounge experience is the if you have worked up an appetite during your treatment, there is an amazing Mexican restaurant (Taqisa) just a short five minute walk to the south of the salon.  Best Baja Mexican food on the island.  Think Street tacos, Burritos with tender pulled meats and fresh salsa made daily.  A definite must if you are a foodie and enjoy south of the border authentic Mexican cuisine.",5,2021-02-02

After the cut it was blow dried and then styled. Hairdresser Agus was fantastic and did a great job. My daughter was with a spa therapist (I cannot recall her name) who took amazing care of her. She was put in a mini sarong, given a hair wash, head massage with the hair mask and then a shoulder and arm massage whilst the mask was sitting. My daughter took the 'princess' part literally as she wanted the 'Elsa' treatment, so the lady then braided her hair at the end like Elsa.",5,2020-01-06

Staff are friendly and do fantastic massages, the facial was also lovely. Welcome drink and cold towel on arrival which is a blessing 🙏 Rooms are very clean as are toilets and facilities. Free bottled water also available. Sandy was fantastic doing massage as were all the girls and Tuti manager is friendly and welcoming. Also free wifi and free transport for Nusa Dua area although we didn't use this, I will be doing one of the extended packages next time !! We will defiantly be back 💆🏻‍♀️",5,2020-02-07
nusa_dua,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"During my stay in Nusa Dua, my husband and I went to ""Bali refresh Spa"" every day. We loved all the massages, the place is very clean and nice, relaxing music, professional masseurs. Would definitely recommend this spa. They have pick up and drop off from your hotel too.

nusa_dua,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"Was Totally Disappointed worst massage I've had since I've been in Bali my therapist was uninterested in her job, I think they found her on the beach giving treatments,because she was terrible ,I would not recommend going here what so ever,and for the quality of treatment definitely not worth the money,if I could give a lower rating I would",1,2020-01-08
nusa_dua,Bali_Refresh_Spa,"Found this place on trip advisor and we were able to get an appointment within the hour. They even picked us up from our hotel!

tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"There were many turtles in the collection, some of which were very large. There was a guide there that explained all the animals.In addition to the turtle, there were several species of birds and other animals, such as the luwak in the cage . I did not like this place 😕😕",2,2021-09-18
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Awful. Shockingly bad environment for a range of poor animals.Turtles are kept in shallow concrete pools with literally nothing but a tiny bit of sand in the bottom. Not a stone or piece of seaweed. Water looked quite deoxygenated. These are marine animals that dive deep, they are not meant to be kept in 30cm of warm water with no stimulation at all. A range of birds in empty wire mesh cages. An eagle with nothing in cage except a tree branch, that’s it, nothing else. Bats didn’t even have the luxury of a branch. Fruit bats hanging from the mesh at top of their cage. Apart from one that was jammed into a rabbit hutch.Who locks a peacock in a cage? They hang around if fed and treated well. A row of sad birds in small cages with nothing else in them.I was disgusted and fuming!Bali zoo, bird park and safari are great - great examples of how to house animals in appropriate and stimulating environments. This place should be shut down and the owners locked in small empty cages - see how they like it.Please, please, please for the sake of these and future animals do not go. Do not give them any profit from treating animals this way.Absolutely disgusting.",1,2021-06-27
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"A visit to Turtle Island was included in a tour we booked. We were told it was a conservation site for turtles however we would disagree. The turtles are kept in exceptionally small 'pools' about the size of a square bath. They then show you the other animals they have caged or chained which include; bats, and owl, an iguana, toucans, and others I cannot recall. No information on HOW they rehabilitate them to be released, and all are available to take photos with which would imply they are being abused for profit. Very disappointed to have supported this place.",1,2020-04-01
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS!! Glass bottom boat n snorkel were fabbo but this place!!!!! I’m sorry I supported this horrendous place. 30 turtles crammed into a tiny space.. birds, bats, n snakes in terrible conditions..... I’m sorry turtles I really am 😔",1,2020-03-06
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Good place, if what we were informed, regards looking after and healing damaged turtles, for release to the wild again, when ready. Several other animals kept in cages also, they could be doing with some extra funds to improve the area.",4,2020-03-06
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"This is not worth visiting and is expensive. The tour guides are on commission and encourage you to visit. Not a pleasant experience despite the boat price reduced by 50% post negotiations. They mention glass  bottom boat, marine life view,  coral , but this is non existence apart from a few fish. Not really an Island and the turtles are caged. Very misleading",1,2020-02-28
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,My husband and I visited Turtle Island yesterday and were pleasantly surprised.  We got there by glass bottomed boat through which we saw lots of beautiful fish.  The turtles that had been rescued were in clean water although could have done with being in bigger pools.  We got the impression they were cared for unlike some people who have done reviews.  One person said the python had its mouth taped.  This was not the case yesterday and I cannot think why it would have been as pythons do not bite.,3,2020-02-26
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,People please don’t visit this place. These poor animals are not looked after. The python snakes has the head taped up . It’s filthy and it’s expensive for what u get.$57Aud pp. you get a bottomless boat ride but on a cloudy day you can see very little. Those turtles look filthy Don’t recommend you go,1,2020-02-26
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"This place is not doing any animal  conservation.  The poor turtles are in ankle deep filthy water, not enough room for them to swim. They encourage you to touch them for photos. They look so sad and desperate to be free. Then there are the tiny cages for the other animals - monkeys, birds, lizards and a snake with it's mouth taped shut. I actually walked out before we got to that section in tears after seeing the poor beautiful turtles in their hellish enclosures. This place needs to be shut down. The price is a con too, $100aud for snorkelling in filthy water that I refused to do, and a trip in the glass bottom boat to the island which is not an island at all. It's all a huge scam. I hope it gets closed down.",1,2020-02-26
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"We left Turtle Island extremely upset at the poor living conditions these poor animals are living in. Firstly we were charged $118.00 AUD for a one hour tour run through BMR Dive and Watersports. A total rip-off. The brochure shows that the turtles are in the ocean when you visit them. Complete bulldust, this is far from the truth, these beautiful turtles are living in a dirty pond of minimal water. The other animals, birds, goannas are all living in small cages, the snakes looked seriously sick and the mongoose's living conditions brought tears to my eyes, it was in a tiny rusted cage without even a floor in the cage, this poor animal was also not well. To top it off, the cheek of the guide, he tried to say that he was a volunteer and would like a tip. Please please do not support or go to this horrific tourist attraction. It should be shut down immediately.",1,2020-02-24
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"We went on a boat trip to Turtle island under the impression of going to a turtle conservation zoo.At first it seemed exciting to be able to go into the water with these majestic giant turtles, our guide started out with lots of informative information and good fun distracting banter, I struck up a happy positive conversation to delve deeper into what is really going on here,as my thoughts kept thinking of possible buy, keep ,sell,I don’t know however judge for yourself if you go and ask lots of questions.The guide did reveal that the turtles are bought off local fishermen for a sum of money The most disturbing thing is the bird who was terrified of the keeper, very stressed, when approached the bird was squawking, hissing and bristling its neck feathers, the bird would obediently jump on to the visitors arm when the keeper approached, running off terrified after, when I mentioned its stress the guide said “ he likes it “ or they love massage, it was encouraged to hold and pat each animal. There was a very big group of kids and families, kids chasing the birds anything goes here, appalling !!!! , I felt very sad after visiting.Needs urgent action Worst of all the people are so friendly and lovely making a living as best they can, completely unaware of what is ethical or of basic animal care they just can’t comprehend how to care for the animals if only somebody could show the way here.Why are the monkeys there and not at the monkey park orphanage? We where told they where hurt and will be released in two years",1,2020-02-23
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"We bargaind down to $80 US and what a frigging rip off. Boat was dirty, the operator stopped over some fish and just about gased us all, we told him to keep moving. The water was full of trash on the 10 minute boat ride to the most horrendous cages and dirty pools of water to supposedly see animals in a conservation area on the inlet not an Island.  Then you pay for a someone to take you through the cesspool and to use their gross bathrooms.Don't fool yourself every guide gets a cut of where they take you that charges admission and thats how we ended up there to get a ride on the boat with his friend. Do not let them take you to places to eat that they pick, choose your own and have them stop there. If people stop going then maybe those animals can be set free.",1,2020-02-23
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,Only gave it a 1 because I had too. Please do not visit this place and continue the suffering of these poor animals. Concrete pens with inches of water so you can get in and pet these majestic creatures. Other animals kept in inhumane conditions. We will be reporting this place to international authorities for urgent action.,1,2020-02-22
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,This is an amazing place and you enjoy the ride in the boat. You feel you are with thr turtles. The guides are very helpful.,4,2020-02-21
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,The visit to Turtle island was awful.it is claimed that it is for turtle conservation. It is like a zoo out of the dark ages.animals kept in concrete enclosures with no vegetation. The big poor sea  turtles have not enough water to swim and are crowded into a small space. There are other animals like snakes and they have their mouths taped together so they can't bite. Owls sitting on a perch without a tree.The whole place is horrible and a money making scam .I hope they do have eggs in the sand and release hatchlings but there is a better way without being cruel to the animals.The business should be banned! Until they take care of the animals.,1,2020-02-18
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,Not that nice but we enjoy it.. it is not clean and messy.. i hope they clean it and utilize the place in better way,3,2020-02-14
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"I failed to do my ""homework"" before going. We were running out of places to go to, and our guide-cum-driver spontaneously suggested this place, saying the kids would like it. We agreed, without any idea what it was all about.We got to the jetty where we had to haggle with the boat operator to get us to the island. This was when it should have set alarm bells ringing, but I failed to pay heed because they did a good job getting the children excited about seeing animals etc as a distraction. The operator first quoted some price that was plain insane, to probably test our ""appetite"", observing our facial expressions carefully. When he noticed we were not impressed, he quickly add ""but... because we are all Asians, I give you big discount"" and offered a less ridiculous, but still ridiculous, price.I was about to walk away when he offered another ""best price"", and this to-and-fro on the endlessly adjustable ""final best price"" just went on for several rounds before it got to a point when at I was just tired of the process, and when I knew at least I would not be feeling silly and kicking myself, and agreed, just to get on with our day.We had a boat to ourselves (my family and our guide). The boatman must have been the most accomplished sailor ever, being able to steer a boat with his foot and save his hands for cigarettes. He brought us somewhere five minutes out where he handed out some bread to the kids to throw in the water, to attract fish which we could see from the small glass panel at the bottom of the boat.After getting rid of the bread, we continued on the ride to the island, about 10 minutes away. Upon approaching, we saw the signs which informed us we were approaching a ""sanctuary"", and the boatman added that the amount we paid for the boat ride actually included a ""donation"" to the ""sanctuary"" on our behalf. Sounded like we were doing something nice for the animals at this point.We were assigned a ""guide"" at the entrance who would bring us around the place. To his credit, he was friendly and tried his best to keep the children happy. However, his individual efforts could not get us to ignore the signs that ""sanctuary"" was quite likely a misrepresentation.The guide claimed that many of the animals were rescued and brought to the island for conservation. To give them the benefit of the doubt, since there was no way of verifying the animals' histories, it was possible to take their word for it that the animals were indeed rescued from somewhere. However it did feel like they were brought to the ""sanctuary"" for exploitation rather than conservation. There were no rules of engagement for the tourists, and we were even encouraged to pick up the animals (ignoring the animals' and our discomfort) for picture-taking. In some instances, the island guide literally shoved the animals at us, telling us not to be shy, and even suggested silly poses with the creatures for the camera.My children (2 and 5 yo) do like animals in general, and did enjoy themselves on the visit, thinking it was a treat to be allowed to interact with the animals up close, and being to young to be able to fully comprehend the ethical issues. However, the adults did not feel too comfortable on the visit. Guess we learned our lesson, to do some research and read some reviews before visiting the next ""sanctuary"".",2,2020-02-14
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,Don‘t visit this “sanctuary”. It is a living hell for the animals. Look at the pictures and see for yourself!,1,2020-02-13
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,It’s a relatively small place with a lot of turtles and also other kinds of animals. You can do a quick trip while doing other water sports activities at the tanjung benoa beach. It’s about 5 minute boat ride to this place from the main water sports center.,3,2020-02-12
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Did this as part of a snorkeling trip, it is horrible very cruel the poor turtle are kept in only a little water and the snakes have there mouth tapped together, please don't support this",1,2020-02-11
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Despite having read poor reviews we decided to take a boat trip here to decide for ourselves. From the first seconds of arriving you are under no illusion at what a hellhole this is for the animals. Loads of Adult turtles in a concrete pool, families wandering amongst them, touching , and generally filling the pool with bacteria. Even witnessed a young lad laying in the water to the hilarity of the staff. The turtles are treated so poorly its unbelievable. One adult Turtle was in a pool alone in about an inch of water, I asked what the deal was with the animal, the lady said it had been unwell for 3 months and was recovering.  I then asked the man who appeared to be running the show and he told me that it was sleeping. Upon challenging what he said he then barked at his staff member for telling me it was unwell. This particular character walks about the place shouting at visitors to pick up the various animals including a massive lizard,Snakes, various chained birds and even encouraged people to go into a bats cage, which suspiciously hung from one leg,for photos while it supposedly slept. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Please do not go there, it is barbaric.  I do not claim to be the worlds most dedicated animal lover but what I saw has left me with sadness and total disbelief. The squalor,  poor treatment and disregard for the animals here speak for itself. Avoid this place if offered a trip.",1,2020-02-08

tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"The guide that met me was lovely but then proceeded to very quickly move me through the various animal enclosures. My driver had said that you were able to hold a turtle but the guide gave me 2 fake turtles to hold. For a turtle rehab facility, it was extremely small and disappointing.

tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"0 stars if I could. We were first told it was turtle island, and then that it was turtle beach, so we expected to see turtles in the wild and be able to swim with them and see them on the beach. When we got there it said Turtle Farm, and it was absolute disgust. They capture these animals and tell you they rehabilitate them and release them into the wild, and there is 0 proof of it, and they have 50-70 year old turtles swimming into walls trying to get out. Absolutely terrible conditions, they had over 50 turtles in a puddle crammed in. Don’t get me started on the other animals they had caged in with terrible conditions. DONT SUPPORT THIS TREATMENT OF ANIMALS!!!",1,2020-01-23

tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Zero stars if I could. The hotel we were staying at had excursions available and the one we chose, myself reluctantly, was a “turtle sanctuary”. We got to the start point where we boat out of. The sales guy is telling us all the price is 80 a person. We ask why exactly and his English get really bad all of a sudden. I told him the 80 dollar package included snorkeling and we didn’t want to snorkel. We only wanted the $50 package that includes the glass boat in crap water and a trip to “turtle island” which actually isn’t an island by the way. He tried to charge us 70 a person anyway and when he realized we only wanted what the hotel had quoted us in print he gave in. We get there and as soon as we get off we meet our “tour guide”. They immediately ask where you are from so they can gauge their prospects on getting money out of you. My only satisfaction here was that after telling them we were from California I am hopeful they were really let down after not leaving them one cent. I don’t want any tour guide I want to explore myself but there was nothing to explore anyway. Beautiful sea turtles in shallow concrete tanks, then they show us their other animals. A couple of crappy toucans, a snake and finally f’ng turkeys. I flew 20 hours to see turkeys? They ask if we wanted pictures with the animals to which I replied “Not at all”. We didn’t give them a dime. They make us take a picture in front of a turtle statue and try to sell it to you. No thanks. Beverages?? As much as I wanted a beer to take a little sour out of the experience, hell no again. No to any “contribution” or money in any of their pocket. Do not ever go. The biggest waste of an excursion you can ever have trust me.",1,2020-01-19
tanjung_benoa,Turtle_Island,"Unfortunately we wanted our driver to take us to the turtle conservation and education centre which has great reviews on TA. He drove us to the port in Benoa / Nusa Dua and we got sold to by the boat people to take speed boat to the alleged above turtle conservation Centre. Ended up paying 700,000 rupees for 4 of us for speedboat. Massively ripped off. Get there and realise this is turtle island not the conservation centre. ☹️ no baby turtles no opportunity to release into ocean. Just a poorly run zoo with poorly treated animals and reptiles. Beach was dirty full of rubbish, plastic and overrun with boats and Chinese tourists. Very pushy volunteers who expect you to donate and buy souvenirs ☹️",3,2020-01-03

tanjung_benoa,Bhava_Spa_Nusa_Dua,"After traveling around Nusa Dua the day before, we were looking for some places to relax and to our surprise, there’s a lovely little spa on the ground floor of our hotel. We decided to give it a try, without much thought, but this turns out to be the highlight of our day. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who is also our therapist later Sari, who is very patient and professional. She’s painstakingly explained all the options we can have for a spa treatment and all kinds of essence oil that came with it that smelt amazing. We decided to take on her offer of the signature spa, the symphony of earth I believe.We were led into a very tastefully decorated room that smells all kinds of herbs, and it has a sort of soothing effect to get us instantly into the mood for the spa. After undressing, we were treated by a gentle food massage with ginger, salt, and lemon, and it felt great. There were lots of different types of herbs laid out on the table, and it will be for the herbal bath later. The ways the herbs were piled up is like the how Balinese piled up the offering and it has a certain ring to it that felt peaceful. The massage was great and the therapist Tari and Sari were very attentive to our needs and the massage was right on point that made us totally relaxed. The pressure was just what we liked because we filled out a survey at the beginning. I have been having some stiff necks recently and it’s just great that the therapist noticed it on the form and gave more attention to that area without me even asking. Just some several minutes into the massage, and we were told to get ready for the singing ball treatment. We had no idea of how singing ball would come into play and thought it is like the sound treatment we had a couple month earlier, but it was different. They placed different size of singing bowl onto our back and gently knock on the bowl to make it “sing”, generating vibration and the almost dreamy rhythm. I never thought singing bowl can be this soothing when I can feel it directly on my body. This is a must try. We finished the wonderful massage with a herbal bath, with different types of oriental herbs, lemon grass, ginger, pandan leaf, and again they got the right temperature for the bath. We felt quite rejuvenated afterwards. We would highly recommend this spa experience and it just made our day so so much better.",5,2021-11-29

tanjung_benoa,The_Home_SPA,Nice and clean and good price compared to the others! I wished I found this first ! The other massage places are kinda dirty for the same price!!,5,2020-02-23
tanjung_benoa,The_Home_SPA,"Definitely worth a visit. We were staying at the Grand Mirage and this place was just minutes away- across the road and a couple of metres down a sign posted alley. I had researched the spa on trip advisor before coming to Bali and I am glad I did as it was what I expected and more. The spa was clean, relaxing and the service was excellent. Both myself and my husband were very happy with the treatments we received in a clean air conditioned couples room and thought it was fantastic value for money. We have both attended spa treatments at luxury 5 star hotels in Bali before where treatments cost many hundreds of Australian dollars each and the treatments and service here was on par. Yes, this spa lacks the fancy extras such as a private infinity pool for spa guests or stunning ocean views but you also don’t pay for that in the price.My husband and I both came here twice. I had an aromatherapy massage and my husband had a Balinese massage on the first visit which were both 90 min long and cost approximately $25 Australian each.On our second visit which was on our last day, my husband had the 2 hour, happy hour massage and a full body scrub which was a total of 2.5 hrs long and cost $35 Australian. I had a 1 hour shellac pedicure, and a 90min body scrub and massage that cost $55 Australian dollars.If we would of had these treatments at our hotel it would have been more than double the price. Alternatively, I did not want to go on the beach or in one of the many cheap spas along the street they often lack air conditioning, their hygiene standards can be questionable and they offer limited privacy.I would definitely recommend this spa. We also did not have any problem walking in to Home Spa and getting a treatment straight away but they do have a Facebook page and you can message them via what’s app which they can send a spa menu through.",5,2020-02-01

When we came back, we tasted the coffee ground in his garden, it was lovely and he outlined what we would be cooking.  I was with a friend who has never cooked, but he loved it!  Everyone cooked their own food and ate it so everyone had the full cooking experience.  Thoroughly recommend this class.",5,2020-03-09

ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"One of our first stops in Ubud and it didnt disappoint, you just have to watch out for the monkey. As I sat down to rest on a wall, I was approached by a monkey who wanted me to hold it. I quickly realized that they work in pairs. One butters you up while the other eyes you up and down to steal your stuff.  While holding the one, another run up my back from behind, sat on my head for a moment beofre pulling out one of my diamond earrings. They love shiny stuff. After much convincing and realizing he couldnt eat it, he promptly threw it back at me. You wouldnt believe it unless I posted the pics which I have. A while later during our walk around the park, we had one jump on us and try to get into my pack. We had left the zipper open slightly and there was a bottle of sleeping pills inside. Luckily I stopped it, just be smart. Zip up your zippers. Hold on tight to your phone. we saw one lady get hers stolen when she tried to take a selfie with a monkey.",5,2020-09-19
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"Wonderful place to spend some time with a little monkeys! Just be carful and do not feet them. Since ITs not all of them are small and cute , some of them might be big and aggressive! especially If if you are hiding the food! Temple is very big and it will take some time to explore! they have a restaurant near the entrance as well!  The fees is quite cheap and It usually very crowded!Enjoy your day",5,2020-09-11
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"No stay in Ubud would be complete without a trip to its famous Monkey Forest, the name alone sparks the imagination. Its goal of preserving a forested area peppered with traditional buildings and temples all for the purposes of protecting hundreds of families of monkeys is a noble one, and the reverence with which the monkeys are held in (as well as their near-total control of the area) does go a long ways to show this. However, and this is unfortunate, the way the Monkey Forest has been given over to tourists does bring the quality of the experience down. There are signs and constant reminders not to feed, approach, or otherwise interact with the monkeys, and yet a lot of these go unheeded. Because of the influence of belligerent tourists, the monkeys have become a lot more aggressive and demanding in their search for food and other sundries and it definitely leaves a sad mark on the reputation of the site. We saw monkeys stealing cigarettes from one tourist, which is on one hand a great display of karma, but on the other its most worrisome as you know the monkeys are going to have a bad time finding out that cigarettes aren’t edible. The irony that a spot as famous as the Monkey Forest is both thoroughly funded and fundamentally ruined by tourists never fails to give me existential dread. The scenery and imagery of a wild, winding forest full of Balinese statues and temples, themselves covered in cavorting simians is a wonderful sight to imagine when heading out to the Monkey Forest. The reality of a choked and crowded walkway, blocked with tourists trying to tempt juvenile monkeys with sugary treats will forever hold the Monkey Forest back from its real goals.",3,2020-09-07

ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"Monkeys will bite you even if you are not interacting with them. I was walking the path and one ran up behind my leg and bit me, breaking the skin. (I did not have any food or anything on me).The front desk did not have much to clean the wound; however, a nice girl gave me some hand sanitizer to clean it.If a monkey happens to bite someone with a disease like Hepatitis, Aids, Herpes B, etc. and then bite you....you'll leave with a nasty souvenir forever!Don't recommend AT ALL. (PS my driver also got bit by one!)",1,2020-07-09
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"So fun! The monkeys will only get irritated if you get too close to them, so just don't bother them and they won't bother you. You can still take photos with them, and just be careful if you have food in your bag on in your pockets. You don't really need a guide. It's easy enough to walk around and see all the monkeys running around.",5,2020-07-06
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"A must-do in Bali, for animal nature buffs. Yes, the monkeys are the stars, but those who are into; botany, architecture, stone masonry and or sculpture work (see my YouTube V-log), will be equally enthralled. It is also, just a great place to go for walk.",5,2020-07-04
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,very cute. my favorite spot in Ubud. the sanctuary is very big and a lot of monkeys inside. but don't touch the monkey.,5,2020-07-01
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,We loved our visit to the monkey forest in Ubud. We drove on our moped and there was plenty of parking available outside the forest. Tickets were cheap and getting there was super simple. Be prepared to get waved down by people trying to get you to visit the nearby coffee plantation on your way. The monkeys are huge and they can get pretty vicious when fighting. Don’t get in their face too much because you are in their territory now. As long as you are respectful when taking pictures then the monkeys are quite calm. Don’t panic if they try to climb up you as there are rangers there to help. Too tip is to have a padlock in your bag because those monkeys are super clever and we saw them open up someone’s zip bag to steal the contents. There is a lovely cafe at the entrance serving delicious fruit juices and it is the perfect place for a good instagram picture . Have fun guys !,5,2020-06-24
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"This is definitely one of the highlights when you stay in Ubud. It's a popular, touristy place but worth a visit regardless. If you like monkeys - there are plenty of them here! There's also an art exhibition and the park itself is quite nice as well, with bridges, statues, a valley with a small river etc",5,2020-06-15
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"When we visited Bali, one of us was on crutches with a broken ankle. This made ALL tourist attractions very difficult and tiring to navigate. This was one of the most expensive places to get into but that being said - just getting to see these little guys up close made it so worth it!! This isn't one of those attractions that under-delivers -- you get to see these monkeys running, playing, and stealing things from tourists. It is so fun to see them running freely! We would advise listening to all the warnings about not bringing in food. The monkeys WILL find it, even in a zipped back pack! It might be wise to not take a bag in if you can get away with it. If you're traveling with a person that is injured or handicapped, be prepared for a lot of walking. We didn't get to see much of the forest because it was so spread out and tiring, but what we did see was all ramps and walkways with very few steps which would make it fairly wheelchair accessible. There were areas with steps that we skipped since we couldn't go up and down.",4,2020-06-14
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"A trip to Bali is not complete without visiting these precious monkeys!  Give yourself a lot of time as the sanctuary gets busy!  Don't wear shiney anything (jewelry) as the monkeys will stop at nothing to grab hold of it and not let go.  DO keep your purses closed as they like to rummage through them.  Only feed them food acquired there at the venue. They LOVE food and will get very aggressive if they see it.  Don't try to tease or taunt them with food. They will come after you. There are zoo keepers inside that will take photos of you with the monkey (near you)...utilize them, and tip them well.",5,2020-06-08
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,Bali always has a view to charm its tourists with the nature and its spectacular innocence of how everything is being kept there. If you are scared of monkeys; dont go there.,5,2020-06-06
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"This place is fun, but there were so many people there interacting with the monkeys and not always being very nice. There was no one to monitor it, and so it was fun and beautiful but kind of stressful if you care about the animals.",4,2020-06-03
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,We went there the 4 of us (wife & I with our 2 boys 11 & 13) with no expectations not really knowing what it’s like and we were blown away how genuinely amazing it was to observe the monkeys in their almost natural habitat!,5,2020-05-20
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"I really loved monkeys those were really fun to see. Actually they caught my sunglass but i had another one. Be prepared not to loose your stuffs. Very calm forest with full of wild animals. I took selfie with bats and giant snake. Totally, I would recommend. Great place with good service",5,2020-05-17
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"Our visit to Ubud took us to the Bali swings, a visit to a coffee plantation and then on to the Monkey Forest.It is a chance to see wild monkeys wandering around the forest and also various plantations, trees and temples.The monkeys roam wild although the rangers know how to entice them with bananas. We also saw monkeys escaping to the streets of Ubud.You take a trail and wander about, there is a small waterfall.As you are in nature, have good footwear and plenty of mosquito repellent.",4,2020-04-28
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"We lied right next the Monkey Forest for about 15 months It was always a ""barrel of monkeys"", Sometimes at the break of dawn, on our upstairs balcony...There was an old man on the corner that we called the ""monkey minder"" because he tried to keep the monkeys in the Monkey Forest...A thankless task at best.... He has since passed and we feel fortunate to have been friends with him and to have purchased some carvings of the monkeys from him...He was an excellent artist and they are treasures and reminders of our good times there.... we were there in 2012 so disregard the dates below..",5,2020-04-25
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"Beautiful, shady, very well run, this is a great place to visit. Particularly good so see the Rangers interacting with the monkeys, who are extremely well cared for.",4,2020-04-25
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,Quite a intriguing place to visit. A lot of free roaming monkeys. Don’t be wearing any jewellery or loose items as the monkeys may snatch these. The monkeys will jump on you even when you least expect it. So be prepared. I don’t mind animals so I enjoyed it whereas my wife stood with security as she was scared. Even got to see the monkey King who seemed to be a relaxed monkey,4,2020-04-19
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"My second visit to the Monkey forest. It alot of relaxed walking with much to see and be entertained my monkey families.. There is an art gallery, a fish pond and a waterfall which now block to visitors. There are many temple complexes and lots of opportunities for  photography. There is also a small souvenir shops area. A coy fish pond and lots of places seats to relax and enjoy the view.",5,2020-04-17
ubud,Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"Well, kiddos saw that monkey isn't as cute as them at cartoon movie😁😁😁 The monkey seems know everything inside the visitors bag 😂😂😂 My kiddos shocked when there is a monkey trying so hard to open a visitor bagpack to reach his cigarette. Maybe he thought it was a food 😅😅😅But the park guardian really good for the job. They always ready if there is any  monkey who annoyed the visitor. They spread around the park.👍👍👍You won't be lost inside the park bcoz there lots of sign anywhere.👌👌👌",4,2020-04-17

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,We go to this place because near to our resort. I stayed at Sri Ratih for 3 nights. Campuhan Ridge walk is the best place for joging at ubud area,5,2021-11-17
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"One of the must visit venue in Ubud. Many people can't find it since it's hidden and located behind Pura Gunung Lebah. Turn in to Ibah Warwick's resort and you will find a local school which you can park your bike/car. From there, go down the stone stairs and follow the path. There's a local guide providing his service, but you don't necessary need it - exploring by your own would be so interesting.",4,2021-09-29
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Surrounding of valley and forest , there is best place for take a refreshment for self, came on early morning to see the beautiful sunrise and don't forget to visit the temple Pura Gunung Lebah for spiritual vacation",5,2021-09-01

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"I like this place. No motorbikes, great views, now and quiet in Covid time And bearable in normal times. A few cafes along the way if you get too hot and thirsty. It’s fun too to watch all the local couples up there taking their In Love photos. Perfect selfie spot.",4,2021-04-15
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Place where you can take a great picture, chill, walk to reach ricefield area.It's a must when you're in Ubud",5,2021-04-12
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Located in central of Ubud, I think it's one of local fave spot to have jogging. Afterall it has a good up and down with flat route.There are many reason to like this spot for trekking. It gives u a ""jungle vibe"" because u can see plant, grass everywhere even sometimes in your path. However it still gives u the comfort from the paved path given. I survived that path with pencil skirt. Also, the start and finish are 2 different places. I started my walk from a place near Blanco museum. I ended my walk to a village area that has many hotels and restaurant with rice field view. Unfortunately, when I came there around 8, there weren't many places that open already.Is it worth the hype? I don't think so. I'd say u gotta have the perfect timing and legit photographer to get a insta worthy photo",3,2021-03-25
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Better than no nature. But definitely on the short side of things. Now with COVID no other tourists and hence empty. With more tourists will surely be packed and not sure if enjoyable.,3,2021-02-13
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Nice long walk along the ridge with interesting views along the way and a few places to stop for a drink or to eat near the end of the walk.  Great to do on a nice day!,5,2020-12-25

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Refreshing and energizing walk in the nature to see stone bridge, big rocks in the river waters and green lushes around",5,2020-08-11
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"The path is well maintained and easy to get to. It’s a nice walk, good views. There was no one there when went. There is not a lot of shade so I would recommend doing this in the morning before the heat.",4,2020-07-28
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"We strolled Campuhan Ridge and back and absolutely loved it. We went mid afternoon and found it relatively empty, although bear in mind the walk is quite exposed and there's not really much in the way of shade. For us it wasn't a problem as the weather was just right, with a cool breeze. The walk, which takes about half an hour each way, took us alongside a lush jungle and we stopped multiple times for photographs.",5,2020-06-24
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,it was quite a good walk. takes more time than the internet actually tells us. it was good fun since we were quite a few of us.,4,2020-04-20
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"A beautiful nature walk on a ridge that allows you to admire the view and the few rice fields. It is best to go early to enjoy the peace.A great way to start the day!To have quit look of the walk, we did an amazing video on YouTube Watch it on our channel:  Better2Boutside",4,2020-04-13
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,We did this walk early in the morning! I would say the best time because it’s the coolest and the sun coming over the ridge was spectacular. If you keep walking far enough there are some homes with small businesses. And if you keep walking farther there are some open rice fields that are stunning with the sunlight hitting them. There are a lot of Airbnb here to stay in that look gorgeous. After we complete the walk we went to where it started and turned right and walked all the way into town. This was a very manageable walk which was just very slightly uphill on the sidewalk by the road. There is a beautiful walkthrough where the cars go that have vines hanging down. I would highly recommend this walk as it is so peaceful in the morning.,5,2020-04-12
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Although the trailhead is pretty tricky to find,  it was a good,  short hike.  Plan on doing this either in the early morning or late afternoon because once you are on the ridge,  there is little to no shade.  To get up on the ridge,  it is a short,  climb (some might say steep). Really took our time it only took us an hour,  roundtrip. Pretty scenery,  but we were hoping for more. I still would recommend, though.",3,2020-04-02
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"This an interesting walk as there is a great variety in the scenery along the way. However, although we consider ourselves good walkers, we started out at 10am on a very humid (normal Ubud) day but even wearing hats on the open pathway, we suffered quite badly from the heat. Advice would be to try it either very early morning or at dusk.",4,2020-03-23
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Lovely walk with my boyfriend to make the most of a calm evening. Stopped off at a couple restaurants for drinks and food,4,2020-03-22

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Perfect nature and good walking area, but there nothing special, or incredible. Just pure nature, which you can find all around Bali.",3,2020-03-19
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"We didn’t see what all the hype was about.. thankfully this is free, because we would have felt duped if we had to pay. The view was less than amazing and there were a bunch of shops along the roadside close to the end. Nothing special, wouldn’t recommend.",2,2020-03-14
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Not that good actually.Foliage is so long along the edge of the path that you cant even see the view.Wouldnt recommend,2,2020-03-13

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Spent our fist morning in Ubud walking this path. Beautiful views, tranquil setting. Loved walking through what felt like authentic villages with great local artisans, warungs, etc.  Peaceful feel and great way to absorb some of the local culture.",5,2020-03-11
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,A lovely gentle walk with fabulous ravines either side - ended with a fresh coconut overlooking the jungle treetops.,5,2020-03-11
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,It’s better to go further on the island than going on that “walk”. Short and not well maintained. At the end there are some shops and bars where you can order some drinks and it’s needed cause you’re walking under the full sun. But it’s not an exciting thing.,3,2020-03-10
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Go in the morning on this hike before it gets to hot, also a little bit tricky to find. Enter by hotel Ibah. Very nice views and nice morning hike. Truly recommended!",5,2020-03-10
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,I walk this at least every other day. Ideally before breakfast. Always amazes me that in Ubud the jungle is only ever one block away. Beautiful view of Kuntamini volcano on a clear day.,5,2020-03-10
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Great walk to see Sonera of the beauty of Bali.  A great place to wind down from the business of the market.,4,2020-03-07

ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"The trail is centrally located, accessible to all levels of fitness and free. Go early in the morning to avoid the heat. There’s a nice spot in the town at the top ridge where you can have breakfast amongst the rice paddies.",5,2020-03-05
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"It is a very easy and quite short hike. You will be surrounded by stunning mountains, rice fields, coffee shops and art studios. This was a highlight of the afternoon.",5,2020-03-05
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"It's a nice walk, especially if you do it in the early morning or after rain/storm. Can get harsh when it's sunny as there is not much shade.",4,2020-03-05
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Interesting walk with some beautiful scenery along the way...Definitely worth doing!The steps at the start were a bit of a struggle (a few joint issues, hips and knees) but once we were on the ridge, it was just beautiful!",5,2020-03-04
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,We ended a trip cycling at this beautiful walk. Not too strenuous and gorgeous views. Would be a bit too hot in summer but in March it was fine.,5,2020-03-03
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,This walk was really nice. Brought My drone for more amazing views. It's about 2km long which is enough in the heat.,5,2020-03-02
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,Over grown plantation along side of path. Making small tracks to walk on. Some good views. You might find some other rice field walks more inspiring.,3,2020-03-02
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"The Campuhan Trail was only a 200m walk from my hotel. It is a 2km out, 2km back route. Undulating terrain overlooking non commercialised rice fields. I was a little concerned going on my own and early due to being remote, but even early there were lots of people out walking or running. Scenery was nice and a good place to run, but if it is not  close to you and your not into doing exercise, then it's probably not worth a special trip/drive out.",3,2020-03-01
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"Pretty good for those of you who like to take pictures, get out of Ubud hustle and do little trekking.  But it is not suitable for kids, because of the way up and down and no fence/barrier. Pretty good place for  short trekking (only 2 km). Reccomended place to visit if you are in the area.",4,2020-02-28
ubud,Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,"These are one of the best natural trecks I have seen in Asia: at sunrise, noon and sunset. Great for walking, running, photography and meditation. I am missing it already!",5,2020-02-28
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,A beautiful small pond situated behind Starbucks in Jl. Raya Ubud. Worth for a short visit - don't missed it.,4,2021-09-29
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,Literally I’m not sure about the religious meaning of this temple. The front square is considered to be a performance site. You need to visit it when you go through ubud.,4,2021-04-14
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"This is one of those “blink and you’ll miss it” temples, not too far down the street from the Puri Saren Palace. Much like the Royal Palace, if you didn’t know it was there, you would easily walk right on by, which is strange seeing as Saraswati feels three times taller that the Royal Palace and has its entrance flanked by gorgeous lotus ponds. While Saraswati might not offer the most things to see, bar its entrance gate and the lotus ponds, they are such a striking, serene image that it’s no wonder they offer a service on wedding photos there. As far as a tourist spot goes, it’s a very brief stop but a beautiful one at that. There’s something about a good water feature that just calms the soul. If you’ve got five minutes and want a beautiful photo, Saraswati is where it’s at.",4,2020-09-07
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,Beautiful temple in the centre of Ubud with a big lotus pond in the front. The entrance is free. Great spot for taking photos any time of the day.,5,2020-09-02

ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"A lovely Hindu temple located right in the centre of Ubud. The entry is free and there are lots of beautiful gates, which present many photo opportunities.

ubud,Saraswati_Temple,Beautiful layout and colors. Much variety and again not too many people when were there in early March.,5,2020-04-21
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"This is a beautiful place to visit, right in the heart of Ubud. I came here in March looking to have the perfect views with the reeds in the water, but I wasn't able to get these views. But it was still able to give me some gorgeous views. This is free entry Super easy to find - right in between Lotus Cafe and Starbucks. Or you can see it when dining at Lotus Cafe. If you want to get great photos, maybe visit early as this place is always crowded",4,2020-03-08
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"close to other major tourist attractions makes this easy to fit into your schedule, and is in most day tours worth the visit",4,2020-03-07

ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"Off the main drag behind Lotus Cafe is Saraswati Temple. It is a lovely serene space with two large ponds full of lotus plants. Lotus are amazing plants at any time of the year, but when they are all blooming this temple is truely stunning. Very worth a visit and a quiet stroll around away from the madness of Jalan Raya.",5,2020-02-26
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"Tucked quietly in an otherwise extremely busy Ubud market is this gem of a temple. When you approach the main compound from the main street, you have no idea what's waiting inside to welcome you and when you notice a pond fully covered with big green lotus leaves and long stems of beautiful lotus flowers standing straight, you would bound get awed. Add to this picturesque view the beautiful facade of the temple right in the middle.A must visit place",5,2020-02-13
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"A beautiful temple and perfect for pictures if there is not too many other tourists there. A lot of details on thee temple and the ponds on each side of the walkway up to the temple must be pretty when the flowers bloom. Not so much to see or do there, so it's just a nice ""walk by-place"" between other activities. For example on your way to Campuhan Ridge Walk.",4,2020-02-12
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"We stumbled upon this little gem as we walking back from the rice terraces and spent the next hour filling up the memory on our camera our kids were fascinated and the care taken in the maintenance was outstanding, definitely worth a visit my tip go early as when we were there we had the whole place to ourselves.",5,2020-02-01
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"A good temple to visit,we spent around half an hour here,the lotus blooms were faded when we visited(February)but even so it was still very pretty.There is no entrance fee,and it’s a good spot for photo opportunities,the one thing I was not keen on Starbucks are within the temple grounds.",4,2020-02-01
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"If you're in the Ubud area, i would suggest to swing by for a picture with the temple in the back and lily pond around you. Overall it's very nice but there's not much to do or see. we spent maybe 10 mins here for a few pics. There was a Starbucks at the entrance so kinda tells you how significant historically it is.",3,2020-01-29
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"We enjoyed taking photos there specially the lotus in the water. we watched the show there and it was average with Balinase dancers.The mosquitos there were terrible and Bali in general and I think that they can clean it in a better way to attract more people specially kids, I spent my whole time worried that my kids could fall in the dirty water.",3,2020-01-26
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"Not worth a detour, little own a trip.  The ponds are pleasant, but you will see many more without the press of tourists mindlessly taking selfies.",1,2020-01-15
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,"You can feel the peace and tranquility when you are there, also the location is right in town just a few meters away.After the visit you can relax in the coffee shop which is next door",5,2020-01-06
ubud,Saraswati_Temple,The pond and the temple is good. But we can only go until the entrance gate. So it's just that small place. The entrance was beside a cafe which was a bit difficult for us to find as there is a Starbucks at the entrance and we thought it's Starbucks and went around different streets to find it.,4,2020-01-05
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,Great activity walking a great track with rice fields surrounding you so calm and peaceful a lovely walk,5,2020-11-03
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,We loved every minute of the walk. Lots of beautiful scenery along the way. Met some friendly locals. A couple of steep spots at the beginning but once past that it was easy going for a middle aged woman with a bad knee...lol.,5,2020-03-22
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,This place is a must visit. We really fell in love with nature here. It is so pretty. The locals are very friendly here.,5,2020-03-03
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,This was the second of two walks we did on consecutive days and was our favourite. It really does give you a flavour of the town and it is great to get away from the centre and see how the long sleeve.A quick google will give you many results which details where to start the walk and so on. We found it very easy as long as you have the right footwear and plenty of water.There are places to get food and drink on the way and you will get some excellent photographs. A really nice way to spend an hour or so.,5,2020-02-22
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,"I actually love this hike. It made my soul very peaceful. When walking there you walk pass plenty of rice fields, a man selling homemade wodden art, a fruit stop, a restaurant with a rice field view,  many ducks and chickens, an older smiling woman with a cute puppy dog (that unfortunately needs medical help), and also many farmers who work hard on the fields.  Its not the hazzle like in ubud town and it has a very laid back atmosphere. Quiet. It's also possible to do a round tour by yourself, although I think I lost track a bit.",5,2020-02-20
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,"An easy, pleasant and short walk (approx 1km) through fields. I took the Jl Kajeng “entrance”.  I started out around 8 in the morning and came across a few walkers but overall I felt it was still safe as a solo walker.",4,2020-02-05
ubud,Ubud_Kajeng_Rice_Fields_Walk,"Great little walk in the rice fields. Get to see local farmers, animals and insects.Takes about 90 mins or so. When finished just get a grab or kojak back. Bring sunscreen and water Path is a little overgrown, but just keep going ahead",5,2020-01-30
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,We went here on October when we explore ubud. This waterfall is near from our villa. The waterfall was amazing. We are really enjoyed,5,2021-12-05
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,The walk itself is stunning. At the end you are surprised by this breathtaking waterfall and a nice flat place to swim with kids as well.,5,2021-05-25
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,It’s one of the closest waterfall from Ubud center and usually busy with many tourists. However during pandemic it’s very quiet and they start to build a restaurant around it which doesn’t look nice for the environment.,4,2021-05-17

ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"One of the most popular attractions in Gianyar, namely the Tegenungan Waterfall. The tourist spot is located a little deep from the highway, this waterfall has very heavy water so that the tour manager provides a barrier in the waterfall area so that tourists do not go to the very heavy waterfall for his safety.",5,2021-01-19
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"After paying Rp20k and running the gauntlet of stalls you descend the many concrete steps to a construction site alongside the brown, polluted river. There were plastic bags and even a dirty diaper strewn around.  The waterfall itself is dramatic. It must have been beautiful once. You probably have better things to do with your day now.",2,2020-10-26
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,I come to bali very often! And I will always come back with friends!For those who doent like the bali swing because its far and expensive this place will a solution! One of the best waterfalls around the area!Enjoy a couple of hours over there at least! You can find food parking and etc around and its a very near to the center !cheers!,5,2020-09-09
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"We visited Tegenungan Waterfall as one stop of several we made during a tour through Ubud as part of the Discova tours. The area serves as both a tourist hub, a religious site, and a legitimately beautiful scenic spot (which may account for the first two things).  Two things to be aware of before heading to check out one of Ubud’s most iconic waterfalls are these: the stairs and the weather. We took the stairs from the main entrance of the site down to the river that the waterfall flowed into, and whilst the way down wasn’t that bad, the way back up was a workout we were was not ready for at that time in the morning. As for the weather? We went to Tegenungan the morning after the first serious rainfall in Bali for months and the waterfall, as a result, was a violent, brown frothy rage curtain of storm water. Don’t get me wrong, it was still majestic in its own way, but all you need to know is that depending on the time of year and the weather, your photographic results may vary.",3,2020-09-07
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This waterfall is beautiful and can be reached by descending down a vast amount of steps (which you will have to climb up), therefore significantly good physical health is required. There are gorgeous photo-op spots on the journey from the entrance to the waterfall (and waterfall to the entrance). I recommend you go at the crack of dawn to beat the crowds as we did. The pond did look a bit dirty and there was some litter here and there (Hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), therefore we decided not to swim but the view was stunning! All in all, I would definitely recommend this place!",4,2020-08-14
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Part of our day out with private driver (see review on hidden Canyon for morning part)This waterfall, the walk from car and the surrounding countryside is beautiful. Take your own food though! Plenty of stops for cold drink and ice lollies, but if Bali belly not what you are wanting advise taking a picnic of your own.",5,2020-07-16
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,This was the final stop with our driver on a packed day trip in Ubud that included the Monkey forest.You pay a fee to access the waterfall. You get good views from various vantage points and then it is a bit of a walk to actually get near the waterfall.Popular with locals and visitors. There were people paddling in the water under the fallsJust remember that you have to go up some steep steps to get back to the car park.,4,2020-06-27
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This waterfall very popular ,full of tourists,and there are many IG spots,so you have to wait if you want to take photos,like bird nest,heart shaped nest etc.the waterfall itself is nice,but crowded,have to wait,then you can take a nice photo,some tourists quite self centered,they dont care others.you wait for long time,but they repeat their pose again and again.so you have to go away first,if not wasting your time.if you climb up to the hill,you will be charged, it is managed by another operator, there is swing,IG spots again here,besides, you can overlook the waterfall,amazing view.maybe you have to come here early to avoid crowds.",5,2020-05-31
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This is a cool waterfall in a beautiful Bali setting. You have to go down quite a lot of stairs to actually access the waterfall, but along the way you will get awesome views of the waterfall and opportunities to take photos. Once at the bottom of the stairs, there is a small temple pool that you can bathe in if you please. After walking a bit further, you will reach the waterfall in all its glory. The water is quite shallow, and you can get pretty close, but you cannot go directly under. When you're done checking out the waterfall from below, you should cross the small bridge and head up the stairs on the other side. Although there is another small entrance fee, this side will give you access to the ridge/cliff directly adjacent to the waterfall, so you can see it from above and you can take awesome photos right next to the stream of water. There are toilet facilities available, but you want cleaner facilities you have to pay.",5,2020-05-05
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"There were plastic bottles everywhere, the water was pretty gross, but worse of all there was a soiled nappy that I stepped on. Better from a distance..",1,2020-05-02
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Lovely view from the top and some nice areas to take pictures on the way down.  Sadly once there you couldn't help but notice all the garbage on the banks and in the water.  Totally spoiled the experience.  Also a bit run down and in need of some TLC.  A such better option is the waterfall at Tukad Cepung.,3,2020-04-19
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,This place is good for a late morning dip. The waterfall can be too rough sometimes so you need to go there with good weather and not after heavy rain. The small entry fee is ok. It can get crowded but it's still a nice place to visit. I would include it as a stop during a daily tour of other waterfalls around Ubud,4,2020-04-12
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"We went here cause our previous day to see waterfalls were washed out due to rain, so we went here the next day. It was nice, a little commercial, and I didn't think this waterfall was all the spectacular. It was a quick stop maybe 1 hour tops for a quick photo and a walk.",3,2020-04-07
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"It is a short walk from the parking lot to the viewing point past a number of restaurants and shops. The waterfall itself is a hike down the valley, maybe 15 minutes down a lot of uneven stairs.  Going down, and especially coming back up is a good short workout.  It was kinda crowded, wish we would have come in the morning when it is reportedly less so.  All in all worth the stop for us but then we had lots of time this trip.......",3,2020-04-07
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Be prepared for steps!!! And not regular sized ones either. Lots of people swiming below the waterfall kind of put me off. Picturesque but crowded.,3,2020-03-31
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Next stop on our tour was Waterfall Tegenungan Village. We did not go all the way down to the pool and falls, but enjoyed the view from the top. If you had your bathing suit and at least a couple of hours free time it would be worth walking down to the falls. Lots of development work down in the bottom near the water and falls.",4,2020-03-31
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Had to pay a small fee to get in, walk pass some  market shops and start the steep long descend down. Was nice to get up to but really only stopped for 5 minutes to have a look. none of us in a group of 10 had a swim as the water was very dirty and rushing a bit hard for the younger children. walked back to the bottom of the stairs were we had a bintang before attempting the long way back up. luckly there was a few places to stop and have a photo opportunity to have little breaks on the way up.worth having a look and swim if you can",4,2020-03-31
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Nature at it's finest.... Wonderful feeling just enjoying the sound and water spray in the air... take a deep breath of pure life...,4,2020-03-28
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"One of my best experiences in Bali was this waterfall. One needs to buy a ticket worth 20,000 Indonesian Rupiah and take the steps down to the waterfall. A thunderous waterfall which leaves droplets splattering on your face. It was just amazing! The rocks are a little slippery and one needs to be careful and needs the right footwear. We had a great time taking pictures at various points from the Bird Nest to the waterfall. If you don’t want to go down, then you can also take a picture from the top which offers a beautiful landscape of the waterfall. After spending a lot of time at the waterfall, we headed back to the parking and our car from Sanura Tours & Travels was waiting for us.",5,2020-03-22
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"We visited here on a tour. It’s quite a steep climb up and down, and the steps are quite deep. I love waterfalls so had to get in. It’s not an easy thing to do as there isn’t really anywhere to get changed apart from a dark very small cubicle. You can’t really close the door as it was dark inside. Getting into the falls isn’t easy as you have to climb over a lot of rocks. It’s roped off so you don’t go too far as the falls are quite strong. The water isn’t clear due to it churning the bottom up. I’m glad I went in but as a sixty + I felt I had to tred carefully.",5,2020-03-21
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,This place is really beautiful. It's so in the middle of the nature and these waterfalls are so big. You pay 15.000 Rp per person  that's like 0.80 Euro... that like nothing for us.At the waterfalls you can swim and take sun. Above there are restaurants where you can eat or drink something like coconut water or amazing fruits shake.I recommend you to come here. It is a walk down and then again up but really to do.,4,2020-03-21
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Fun beautiful scenery! A must see and do whilst you are in Bali. Look and explore the beautiful scenic experience and embrace the natural scenery,5,2020-03-20
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Very strong waterfall.  You can go in the water and swim. It was fun. Just watch the falling water and enjoy.,5,2020-03-20
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"It’s important to note that even if you don’t plan on going down to the waterfall, you still have to pay the entrance fee. Unfortunately due to the weather and having two small children with us, we only saw the waterfall from the viewing platform and it was very pretty. Lush green surrounds and good vantage points to take photos. Loved the nests where you can take pics, too! Our son thought they were brilliant! Our visit was pretty quick, in and out in a matter of 10mins (it started to pour soon after we left so we timed it well) so wasn’t the greatest visit, but would still recommend.",4,2020-03-19
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"The best time to visit the waterfall is early morning when you can have it all by yourself, with no crowds around. If you have time, you must visit the nearby Kanto Lampo waterfall and Tibumana waterfall along with it. It is located next to Tegenungan village, in the south of Ubud, away from the regular hustle and bustle. It looks very impressive. However, be prepared for the crowds. The entrance fee is Rp 15,000 per person.",5,2020-03-18
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"You are dropped off at a point with many restaurants and shops. A short walk to the viewing point.  The waterfall itself is far away about 20 min walk ( a lot of stairs, ) . Entrande 20K. As far as we are concerned not a recommended visit.",2,2020-03-14
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"The Tegenungan Waterfall is a very popular spot with locals & tourists as it is fairly close to the city, just 10 km outside Ubud. The waterfall is open from 6:30 am – 6:30 pm. However, the best times to enjoy it would be between 9:00 am – 3:00 pm.Visitors can park their cars at an open parking lot at IDR5,000. There is no charge for motorcyclists. Lockers & toilets are available but chargeable, as well.Walking a few steps ahead after getting our tickets, we were greeted by a very large signage of “Welcome to Tegenungan Waterfall”. Along the way to the waterfall were shops selling food, drinks, swimming paraphernalia & souvenirs. Since we were pressed for time & I had some ankle issues, we walked to a viewing point area or location. From there, we could see a full view of the Tegenungan Waterfall from afar. There were many people at the waterfall. We could also see a wedding photo opportunity taking place! We took quite a few photos of the waterfall in the background surrounded by a lot of greenery & rocks before leaving. It was quite surreal. I could almost feel the cooling water on my skin.The waterfall may be categorised as a small one but its gushing water is undoubtedly very strong. The water that plunges into the pool below is not very clear. However, it does provide a cool respite against the hot weather around the year. Since it is not very high, you can find thrill-seekers jumping off the cliff despite having prohibitive signs around. The water may not be deep enough to cushion the jump downwards.Further reading suggests that one must walk down approximately 150 concrete wide steps with safety rails before reaching the waterfall area. A restaurant with an open-air design has been built near the falls. There is also a large swing for insta-worthy photos which we had missed.",4,2020-03-13
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Stunning view, nice to visit on a day experience trip near Bali! You should include it in your tour adventure with any tourism local agency!",5,2020-03-10
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"We visited the fall in March 2020 and probably saw it at it's worse. It rained alot, the water was brown and swimming was off limits. Despite the bad weather, there were still quite a lot of people and the whole experience felt a bit artificial.If you're the type of person that likes to swim, you have a good group of people,  you have good weather and the pools are open, this could be for you. It wasn't for us.",3,2020-03-09
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Looking for your IG photoshot - don't miss this.  Clambering up rocks to find a spot to under the waterfall is worth it to feel the rush of fresh water hit your face.  Best to wear aqua-shoes with good grip to avoid slipping.,5,2020-03-09
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,When we say waterfalls we expect a loud sound of water hitting the pool below with fine spray of water causing small rainbows here and there. Here it looks like a river flowing over some rocks and not falling as you would expect. If Niagra falls as bomber one this come at number 100. Good for a morning workout going up and down the stairs. There are. Many more places to see in Bali,2,2020-03-08
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"If you’re in the area probably worth a visit but extremely underwhelming. As it is wet season the water is a real dirty colour and you’re not allowed to get in when it’s that mucky. Even in dry season we heard it’s still not exactly clear or that nice to look at, only looks good on massively edited insta models pics.",3,2020-03-08
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Take your costume, there is a spring water pool 167 steps from the top where you can refresh, not much further is the waterfall, where you can have a swim too, a long slog to the top again",5,2020-03-07
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,seemed dirty and natural environment seemed a little distroyed. For the price just not worth it! Bridges unstable too.,3,2020-03-07
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Wasn’t really expecting this size of a waterfall to be awaiting me in Bali. Great surprise and you can go all the way to the bottom. Note there is a steep climb up,4,2020-03-03
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,This stunning waterfall has had some tourist friendly upgrades to make it safer and easier to access.We were very fortunate to go when it was quiet but i can see this would not be as peaceful if there were many tourists around.There has been some heavy rainfall lately so the waterfall was spectacular!There are other photo opportunities  the current is very strong. Small fee to enter but worth it as it all goes to maintaining the area and keeping it safe for visitors.,4,2020-03-01
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,An impressive waterfall but very busy and very touristy. Its actually accessible from two different directions and has two different names but it is the same waterfall. Worth a visit for the photo opportunities but if you don't like crowds choose a less visited but equally impressive waterfall like Leke Leke.,4,2020-02-24
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This is a beautiful place, it's worth a visit, long way down plenty of steps but well worth it, you can also swim in the river by the waterfall",5,2020-02-24
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,Ok their are a lot of people that want to see this phenomena but it's understandeble why. It's really worth visiting.,5,2020-02-24
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This is a really nice waterfall that usually has people wading in the water. I went after a heavy rain, so the water was rushing a little fast for many people. Also after a heavy rain, the water is a little dirtier. The pictures you see are from above the steps. There are hundreds of steps to get down to the waterfall. Above the steps are ice cream shops and street corn vendors. The street corn was really good with garlic, but it gave me Bali belly.",5,2020-02-23
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,The Tegenungan Waterfall is lovely and we really enjoyed it. There are lots of great opportunities for pictures. We were there at mid day so the climb back up was very hot and challenging. Still overall worthwhile!,4,2020-02-23
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"This spot is amazing. Great way to spend an afternoon. Fantastic scenery, swimming pools, which were a bit over chlorinated. Bar and restaurants served great food and the service was quick, professional and friendly. There is a swing out over the cliff, pods, nests and a day bed for great photo opportunities. There is plenty of seating, tables and chairs, coffee benches with bean bags etc. It wasn't crowded. We got a table straight away which I found surprising seeing there was nine of us.  The only thing I could fault it on was there was no railing around the edge of the cliff. The youngest child we had with us was 5. I would have been very nervous with children younger. Well worth the visit.",5,2020-02-22
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Hard to review this one. It was quite a few steps down to reach and absolutely packed with tourists but we got to cool off and the kids liked the novelty of swimming next to the waterfall. We got almost as much pleasure from a small spring water pool tucked away to one side which we had to ourselves. I wouldn't make a special trip here but if you're passing by and feel you have time, why not?",3,2020-02-14
ubud,Tegenungan_Waterfall,"Nothing good comes easy and the 160 odd steps down and back up to this fantastic place are not for the infirm or even slightly hindered folk. As always down is the easy part. 160 steps doesn’t sound a lot but trust me, the long and high stride of each step takes its toll by half way and I wouldn’t say I’m that unfit. I made it in one go but many were stopping along the way. Mind you, the stopping points offer great photo opportunities.Above the waterfall is a restaurant and a jungle swing that offers the adventurous the chance to swing out over the waterfall.Swimming under the waterfall is understandably forbidden but you can get within 10 feet or so which gives a good enough idea of the power of the falling water.All in all, well worth the visit.",5,2020-02-13
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Apparently this place is normally packed out, but thanks to Covid I was the only visitor on the day I went. An extensive site with various waterfalls, temples and paths. Beautiful just for a picturesque walk. I would have liked a bit more information about what I was looking at. They have guides but I also like to go at my own pace and get lost in my thoughts so I didn’t opt for that. Lots of steps and water so make sure you’ve got your non slip shoes on! Good for photos",3,2021-03-04
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Small Temple but worth the visit! The carvings are truly impressive! There's a Hindu and Buddhist temple on site!,5,2021-01-16
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"This place was fenomenal, hard to explain about the cave and story, believe or not. When you come to bali dont forget to visit this place.",5,2021-01-12
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"As the only tourists here during our visit, we had a fabulous experience enhanced by a guide within the temple. This is truly a special place in Balinese history and through our guide we were able to step right back in time and imagine what would have been happening years before.We enjoyed a walk around the grounds but have to say, we were thankful all the shops inside the grounds were closed. This part of the walk would have been a nightmare and would have ruined the experience.Please keep the shops/stalls out of this area completely.....",4,2020-12-13
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"This was the second stop for us on a private day tour with a Bali Res Centre driver. Goa Gajah, also known as the Elephant Cave Temple, was formed in the 9th century. The exact origins of the cave are uncertain, however, it is believed to have been built as a sanctuary for spiritual meditation.Both my brother and I were taken aback by the site, not only by the intricacies of the carvings, but the wonder at how the site was carved by hand, and how serene the environment was.",4,2020-10-30
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Must see , when in Ubud, Goa Gajah, is a centuries old Holy Hindu Temple, amazing ambience & history evidenced when you visit, have a kelapa Muda & soak up the vibes in this incredible , special piece of Balinese history",5,2020-10-04
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"The Elephant Cave is on every list of ""must sees"" in Ubud.  For us, a complete let down.Your 50 IRB entry fee will come with a sarong, which must be worn by both men and women at Balinese Hindu temples.  We approached the cave and admired the truly wonderful and intricately carved stone entrance.  Definitely a highlight, even though I could not see any resemblance to an elephant.We entered the cave and inside.  You'll see a narrow room, maybe 12 feet to the left and 12 feet to the right, with a small shrine at each end.  That's it.  I can't imagine what this must be like in  high season.We wandered the grounds for a while, thinking we must have missed it.  We crossed a lovely stream with a waterfall and came upon a tour guide.  We asked him were the temple was.  He pointed to where we had been!  For us, this was a complete miss and totally skippable.  Spend your extra time at the Setia Darma House of Mask and Puppets nearby.",2,2020-03-28
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Actually two temples. Hindu and Buddhist. Very interesting conversation with a person who checked tickets about God, bielievs, history of place, excavations and meditation. Very mystic place worth to visit when it's getting dark for it's atmosphere.",5,2020-03-26
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"The temple complex is huge with gardens to explore. However, the cave is tiny inside with the presence of both Hindu and Buddhist elements. Mainly, it seems to be dedicated to Hindu Lord Ganesha. As Lord Ganesha represents elephants, hence the name of the temple is justified. The entrance fee is Rp 50,000 per person.  I love the architecture of the old temple very much.",5,2020-03-18
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"This was the first 'tourist trap' I encountered that was blatantly obvious. You purchase a ticket to walk down stairs, you see a holy water spring/font (very lovely), but the cave itself is an incense smoke filled room with an elephant relic. There Is a waterfall, great for pictures. Plenty of gift shop vendors. I think there were better places to spend some time.",2,2020-03-16
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"see all of the carvings enter the cave, this temple has cleansing fountains to partake in a cleansing ritual, no one was partaking while we were there",4,2020-03-07
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Maybe we were lucky, but when we visited the Goa Gajah there was a lot of offering going on. We couldn't barely see the hands in front of our eyes. There is not much ventilation, but a lot on inscence – still a must see for Ubud and just around the corner. Quite a good half day trip if you combine it with Kanto Lampo waterfalls. Behind the Goa Gajah you can take a path to the Buddhist temple which is further down the valley in the woods. Behind it you will find a small paths that leads to some more holy water wells and with a little climbing involved to the river. Do not forget the moskito spray.",4,2020-03-05
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"A very old temple that's been partially demolished by earthquakes. There is also a Buddhist temple nearby, so if you are already there, make sure you see both. Some steps to walk up and down, but its purely with good environment. There is also a large portion of shops outside of the temple. Some people will offer for guide service for 150K/100K, but I think it's not really necessary.",3,2020-03-03

ubud,Elephant_Cave,"The entrance is the highlight of this site. Yes, it is old, but it is just a 20 foot tunnel that branches in a T. On both sides of the T are small little shrines/offerings. Not much to see. Often this is included in a half day tour since it is not far from the hotels of Ubud.",3,2020-02-23
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"1st scam, directly on parking. Woman sad, that everyone needs a sarong. I had my own and my wife haf skirt long to the ground. Its enough.2nd scam:Guys with bone or wood items. Its not from bones and they are mistificating you about price.3th scam: Guid told us, that everyone must have a guide inside. Dont believe him, just ignore him, if you are not interested in.4th scam: There is a exchange with higher rate then usual in Ubud. So I change 200 Eur, which was 2 940 000 IDR. Guy first give me 2M in 50 000IDR notes and 4x 10 000 notes. I note him, that he is wrong - dont pick up the money, just count it - and he put to table missing 900k, again in 50k bank notes. And take back that 40k in 10k notes and put there 2x 2000k notes. He tried to cheat me twice in one minute! I dont touch that 2000k bank notes and ask him to give me right amount. He give me back that 4x 10k notes and was really pissed off...The temple is almost about nothing and all there is turist trap at all. Waste of time, all locals there are really anoying.",1,2020-02-20
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Small temple with overpriced entrance fee although this does include the loan of a tatty sarong that you must wear before being allowed in. Women are not allowed in if they are menstruating! This is the 21st Century isn’t it? Anyway once you are in you need to be aware of the dodgy guides that follow you like a bad smell until you don’t even realise they are guiding you! Once they have you they then demand $20 for their services – that’s four times as much as the entrance fee. Unfortunately for the guide who latched onto me I only had $2 in cash on me. To say he wasn’t happy is an understatement and put a whole negative vibe on the experience. I just wanted to get out of the place! It may have been a whole lot better experience without the guides but unfortunately I was only left with a sour taste. My advice would be not to bother at all with this place but if you do bother just make sure you tell the guides to where to go when they try to accost you (unless you are happy to pay the $10-$10 fee they demand of course),1,2020-02-12

ubud,Elephant_Cave,"While it has an interesting history, this temple is definitely the one to miss, very small and guides will follow you until you accept and will continue to ask you for money. Would highly recommend other temples in Bali, this one appears to be a tourist trap.",2,2020-01-30
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"We enjoyed all the statues which Bali is flush with.   Wear a hat. There’s a small restaurant there only cash that was good for lunch.  You must wear a sarong  o matter what you have on, no exceptions. Not even you 😂",4,2020-01-29
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Also know as the elephant cave, this place was built as a spiritual sanctuary many centuries ago. There is a place to bathe before entering as many Hindus do before praying here. There are locals wandering around requesting to be your guide but you do not need a guide unless you really want one.  As you walk around you will encounter a small waterfall and some smaller temples along the way. A nice stop on your tour around the Ubud area.",4,2020-01-28
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Nice place but so much litter in the river and around the property.  I wouldn’t go back-  unkept.  Sad because it does have potential,2,2020-01-26

ubud,Elephant_Cave,"I was taken here by a local friend and there were small ceremonies going on at both the a Hindu (ancient Elephant Cave) and Buddhist sections of the area.  However, we spent more time enjoyed our walk to the back of the temple area down the various paths through the trees, across small bridges, streams and water flows.",4,2020-01-26
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Beautiful temple. Previous reviews sum it up. We usually are happy to pay a guide because we love history and culture. The guide asked for 20$dollars. We settled on 10$. He spent ten minutes with us and then asked for more money. It was not worth five dollars. I hate leaving such a beautiful and “spiritual “ place feeling taken advantage of,2,2020-01-23
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Ok, it is a temple and has a story which somebody needs to tell you. If not it is more of the same..When you put it into perspective of the age it’s ok.",2,2020-01-19
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"This is a great spiritual place to visit close to Ubud. I had been worried it would be too crowded but we got there around 9:30/10 and had most of the place to ourselves along with just a few other people.  Beautiful grounds and you can walk most of them, not closed off like many other sites.",4,2020-01-17
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"This place was a real surprise and had a fascinating history. The cave has been founded in the 20's and the other surroundings in the '50s. The cave was probably carved in the 9th century, so it's fascinated how long it has been hidden in the Jungle. The cave itself isn't that deep (it's a T-shaped chamber), but there are other things to see, so don't turn back when you have seen the cave. There are a couple of fountains and waterfalls in the jungle, and there's a massive tree in the middle of the area.",5,2020-01-15
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Beautiful place! Altough inside the cave is very hot and hard to breathe, cave is small so you dont have to be inside for a long time.",5,2020-01-14
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Wij bezochten deze tempel als onderdeel van een dagtrip. De tuin om de tempel heen is mooi maar de tempel zelf is niet echt bijzonder. Je bent binnen een uurtje wel uitgekeken.We visited this Temple in combination on our daytrip. The Templegrounds are nice but the Temple itself is not very special. There were lots of schoolchildren who didn't look very happy..... One hour visit is enough.,3,2020-01-13
ubud,Elephant_Cave,This was biggest hypothetical temple in Bali. Entrance fee is Rp50k for adults and 25k for children (under 12). They charge more because there is a Hindu and Buddhist temple within same complex.The Elephant temple is just a whole is a rock. Which can bare fit 10 people. Its damp and musty smell. My famiky ran out of discust.The Buddhist temple is just a shrine with a hindu lady wishing you good luck and asking for donations.This biggest waste of time and money while in Bali.,1,2020-01-08
ubud,Elephant_Cave,Had a lovely time visiting a very old historic place.To see how it was built in those times was quite mind blowing,4,2020-01-06
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"There are 1000s of temples throughout Bali. This one being the oldest excited us to visit, but there was nothing archaelogically or fascinating to see. Market sellers line up until you hit the 100 + steps going down and then locals trying to sell you guides. Took longer to get past the sellers than viewing the site. Beware of giant red ants. Dont brush past any plants.",2,2020-01-04
ubud,Elephant_Cave,"There are hundreds if not thousands of temples in Bali, this one is a little original, close to Ubud and worth the visit.",4,2020-01-04

ubud,Elephant_Cave,"Our family stopped for a short visit at the Temple, as we were told it was the oldest (11th century) in Bali. The cost was $50,000 IDR for our family of four, and a sarong was provided at no additional cost. We did not find the temple to be crowded and were finished with our tour within an hour. A waterfall was also a short walk away from the site in",4,2020-01-03
ubud,Bali_Eco_Tours,"Climbed Mt Batur for sunrise. Got picked up at 2:30 AM. They provided breakfast at small restaurant before we started.  They provided second breakfast at the top with coffee, eggs, toast, fresh fruit (not the normal banana pineapple papaya - but some more unique - mangosteen, and a couple things I can’t remember). Then we stopped at a restaurant for third breakfast - which was a huge buffet. Totally unexpected - or at least I don’t remember being told about it. On the hike, our guide - Kadek - explained local history, different plants, the recent volcanic activity and was generally a thoughtful and helpful guy. Then we went to the hot springs near Mt Batur which were great. Nice and clean. Other ones on the island not so much. As a bonus, on the way home we saw the rice terraces at Teggallalung. They were outstanding. Then as a second bonus, we went to a coffee plantation for the tour and tasting of about 12 different coffee and teas.  We maybe got the two add ones cause we didn’t spend a lot of time at the hot springs.",5,2020-03-17
ubud,Bali_Eco_Tours,We had a fantastic cycle experience today with kadek mudita and Sanjaya - we started off with a short bit through the busy city  but quickly Kadek took us out up into places we never would’ve never seen if we were on our own -and he took us at our own pace explaining culture and history when we asked - stopped at places for a rest and occasionally for refreshments - cycled through wondrous paddyfields and saw lots of local people plus fantastic temples and places you can’t get to  by taxi .Not the fittest person and not the best cyclist it was still a great experience - quite challenging ( narrow ) and uphill for the first half but then I lovely long downhill ride looking out on the paddyfields and later through beautiful villages that were things we had not experienced in the rest of our Bali trip -have a go it’s great fun! We are mid 50’s medium fitness - one a cyclist and one not really! No one fell off!!,5,2020-02-24
ubud,Bali_Eco_Tours,"We did the sunrise trek of MT Batur. My husband and I are in our early 60 and in decent shape. However, we were concerned after reading the many reviews that it would perhaps be too challenging. Cadek was our guide and he was fantastic.He came prepared and gave us a treking pole which was very handy!! Cadek made sure we stopped frequently to catch our breath and he was very attentive. On top of MT Batur we had coffee, eggs, warm banana sandwich and we rewarded with the most beautiful sunrise! Coming down was much easier and we went to spend one hour in the hot springs, that felt so good! Thank you Cadek, we had a great time.",5,2020-02-20
ubud,Bali_Eco_Tours,"Great guide, really Nice and I had a wonderful time . Timming for the sunrise was perfect. No worries",5,2020-02-13
ubud,Bali_Eco_Tours,"We did a private bike tour. The tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. The view at breakfast of Mt Batr was amazing though some of the food was average. The meal at lunch more than made up for it and was a delicious 3 course meal. People along the tour were lovely, the views were amazing and learning about the culture and visiting a villagers house was wonderful. The whole family has a great time. I highly recommend.",5,2020-01-24

ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,"The Neka Art Museum has a  Balinese and foreign art collection inspired by the natural beauty, life and culture of Bali divided amongst several  Balinese style buildings.  Dutch painter, with Indonesian roots, Arie Smit has his own pavilion for his colourfull painting. Nice museum not far from the centre of Ubud.",4,2020-05-18
ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,Worth a visit to see a lot of beautiful  Ali see art. The building is interesting too and there is a large variety of art. Great for a rainy day or for the art obsessed.( Like me),4,2020-02-26
ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,"This place is great, to see art in it's multiplicity of genres from contemporary to traditional, you want to see the art works here. I will tell you now, some of the works have no credits to the artist or mediums used; but it is so worth it if you have the time and are a lover of art. This is a half day journey into the minds of artists and needs your time to enjoy it.  Don't bother filling up with caffeine at the cafe, its waiting for a headstone. Otherwise enjoy.    P.S The Keris section of traditional and ceremonial knives is very worth a view to see some of the most beautifully decorated handles.",4,2020-02-18
ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,This is in my opinion the best art museum in Ubud. The various schools of Balinese art are well presented - and there are also photos and krisses.,5,2020-02-17
ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,Better read about discovering this unique collection of sacred knives to enjoy the visit at its most. Incredible beauties exposed there. A visit which makes you admiring the talent of balinese artisans.,5,2020-02-12
ubud,Neka_Art_Museum,"For more than 30 years, Neka museum has been the definite place to discover and explore the arts. Access is easy but I would recomment to arrive in the morning, the roads to get there through Campuhan can be very busy in the afternoon.",5,2020-01-15
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"It offers you a food and art market. If you’d like to find authenctic Ubud food, come earlier in the morning, it has a range of snacks, Balinese nasi campur, and ayam betutu, so tasty!The minus point was the place itself isn’t too clean.",4,2021-05-17
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"As the sun goes down, the shopping comes to life in the bustling market in Ubud, Bali. I visited at twilight and found lots of variety, with arts and craft, textiles and trinkets, at the forefront. Some of the space is a bit cosy. Enthusiastic sellers but at no time did I feel it was high pressure. An enjoyable street style market (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Vlog) and well worth checking out.",5,2020-07-18
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Ubud Market was a great way to buy some of the typical souvenirs that you see people picking up in Bali, although in hindsight we found that Ubud was one of the more expensive places on the Island to find those kind of things. We went early morning, after hearing you're more likely to get cheaper prices, due to the superstition of the first buy of the day being lucky.I bought a couple of dresses for around 100,000IDR each. I'd advise checking the quality of the clothes before buying, I noticed holes in a few of the dresses I picked up, luckily before I'd bought them.The famous basket bags that you see everywhere, in various patterns and colours, were selling for around 200,000IDR. I was a bit worried about the haggling situation, I wouldn't say its my comfort zone, but I went in there with an idea of what I wanted to pay and walked away if I couldn't get it. Sometimes they'd keep pushing but I found it overall pretty stress free.",4,2020-06-23
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"We enjoyed a short break here on the return drive to Kuta. Although there were many tourists, there simply wasn't the masses as on previous visits. The atmosphere was fairly subdued, even stallholders refrained from yelling. It's still a very vibrant market, so much merchandise and such variety. If you need a little more excitement, ask your driver to park within the market. I don't know how ours's managed the feat but with a few adjustments to other vehicles by the ticket attendant, we had secure parking for R5,000. The markets are definitely worth visiting if in Ubud or surrounding area, but, as others reviewers have mentioned, hone your bartering skills, beware of scammers, check and re-check anything that you intend purchasing and ensure it remains in full view.",4,2020-03-26
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"While in Bali, we also went to the famous Ubud Art Market and bought pretty handbags and windchime from there. The vibrant market retails everything from clothes to jewellery to bags, souvenirs, footwear, gifting options and much more. Be sure to bargain a lot! We also got a glimpse of the Royal Palace from outside but didn’t go inside.",5,2020-03-22
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"The market is much bigger, than I initially thought so we actually ended up taking it in two turns... It was way too hot anyway.You kind of have the same stuff at every stall, but I suggest to go around first, find out about the prices in general, than go back to a stall that has most of the things you are actually looking at buying and make a good deal for all items. This definitely worked good for us and we ended up paying nothing like the prices we got separately from different sellers.",3,2020-03-16
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Great place with the madness that is Ubud, be careful of scams though, my silver and stamped ring has already gone back to brass. Remember to barter start at half, it's great fun",4,2020-03-11
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,Never again rude vendors .they will get upset if you ask and don't buy .better to buy in Krishna for souvenirs it is much cheaper for the same products,1,2020-03-11

ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Situated right in the heart of Ubud is this vibrant market, you can't miss it, although I wouldn't call it a large market. They sell fruit, bags, sarongs, clothes, water and always the many traditional souvenirs. It is pretty much open from 9am to 6pm - although I found people still trying to sell things well after 6.30pm. I thought there would be heaps more fresh fruit stands, instead of the endless clothing stalls.Just be careful, they will always try and over charge you - they do this in a very friendly way.",3,2020-03-08
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,The Ubud market in Karna Steet is full of colour.. bartering... and all sorts of wonderful things to look at and buy ...clothing..wooden  statues..jewelry..fruit..shoes..bags..coffee..art..just to name a few.It is a very old traditional market with lots of character and atmosphere😊,4,2020-03-07
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"I guess I had a high expectation on this which resulted to my disappointment. Some of the things here (the souvenirs) aren’t that cheap. And adding to my frustration, I could have gotten few things at half of the price in Krisna (the famous souvenir shop in Bali) with a better quality. You really have to be good at bargaining, and if you can speak Indonesian language that’s an advantage so that you can bargain better😅. Regardless of that, I found myself buying lots of things here bcs I always have a soft spot for elders with such a tired and pitiful face telling me to buy things. Such a sucker lol. All in all, it was nice.",3,2020-03-02
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,It is a market with emphasis in art. However it is the same type of art that you are going to see all over Ubud. This time I found the paintings vastly uninteresting.As always you have to haggle like hell as it is only going to be of interest to tourists.,3,2020-02-29
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Classic SE Asian market where you need to bargain. Sorry but most things are useless souvenirs... still, many people find them appealing.",2,2020-02-26
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Glad that we stopped here. Bought a beautiful Balinese painting. Just be very mindful of what your willing to pay. As the locals will trick you. They wanted 900,000 and ended up selling for 300,000. Just be confident when talking to them.",4,2020-02-25
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Kuta market is one of the best local markets you can go to, Bali people are very crafty so you can finds lots and lots of cool stuff at the local markets, just remember that you are expected to haggle so all prices will start very high",5,2020-02-24
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,So much to see here that it can be quite overwhelming. We only stayed a short time but we did manage to snag a couple 'bargains(?)'.,3,2020-02-23
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,This is a nice enough place especially if you like shopping but we didn’t spend too long there.It can get hot and intense and you do get pushed quite a lot to buy things. Most of the things that you can buy in the shops around the area anyway.If you do decide to purchase souvenirs be prepared to handle as that is the way here.,3,2020-02-22
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"It's a great place to go in ubud if you want to buy souvernis. I felt that I could walk in this market without people trying to be on my neck selling. Have a look after an older woman as shown in this pictures, she looks so stunning and so sweet!",4,2020-02-20

ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"The Ubud Market is huge, we didn't even finish walking. There were a lot to see. At the market, we had so much laughs from bargaining! Though I was looking for silver jewelry, I opted to buy from the boutiques instead of from the streets.",5,2020-02-02
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"You walk though hundreds of tiny stalls that basically sell the same things over and over. If you like buying local hand made ""junk"", this is the place. Only thing to be ready for is to bargain aggressively. What ever number they say, start with at least 25% of their number. We got handbags started at 300k Rupiahs down to 80k rupiahs. Same with pants, started at 100k to 20k.We enjoy bargaining with locals and also wanted to buy the local handmade stuff, depends on your taste.",4,2020-01-29
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"The area is filled with beautiful artworks. Some of them are more expensive than others but there is a souvenir for everyone. We were specifically looking for smaller souvenirs, and this was quite difficult but we succeeded. They are very open to negotiate over the prices.",4,2020-01-25
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,Busy market at the centre of Ubud. Lots of tourist goodies or tat to buy. The market is always busy with the hustle and bustle of people coming and going.,3,2020-01-17
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,"Ubud market is a place where you should visit when you are in Ubud, but I would not call it ""Traditional art market."" There are plenty of small stands where everybody is selling wooden figures, sarongs, cashmere (not sure if real) scarfs, wooden penises, and also random goods from China.Be warned that there will be a lot of people, and the first price you will get is the level where you should start bargaining. The first price is usually double or triple price. For example, they might quote sarongs price to be 200 000-300 000 IDR, even though they could sell it anywhere between 30 000-150 000 IDR.",3,2020-01-16
ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,a good market with many stalls selling the same things which made it great for bargaining. we got a bag and jewellery,3,2020-01-16

ubud,Ubud_Traditional_Art_Market,Went to Ubud market. Good art and crafts to take as souvenirs but extremely hot and busy...maybe go early morning. Lots of the souvenirs you find there can also be bought in Ubud on the streets...,3,2020-01-05
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,"We told our driver that we wanted to buy some good Indonesian coffee, not the gimmicky Luwak beans and we ended up in this ""theme park"" kind of tourist trap.  We were tagged on our wrists on arrival and a male staff guided us through the entire place and he even took the trouble to explain the process of extracting the coffee beans after the civet cats pooped out the beans.  Then we were shown the swing area which required a fee depending on the package they offered.  We gave this a pass. Then we were enticed to the shop where all the expensive Luwak beans were put on display and he offered to give us a sampling of tea mixtures and coffee before we commited ourselves to a sale of their special brew.  We turned him down but walked away because we were not interested in that kind of enticement and we were not Luwak coffee drinkers!  The nice thing about this place was that the owners had a good concept of fun entertainment tied in to market their coffee for a price.",3,2020-03-30
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,"We didn’t get past the tasting. We queried the guide as to why we had to share a tasting between the four of us while other people got one per couple. He said because we came in one car. I suggested I come back in another car to which he replied with a raised voice, waving his hands and storming off to go get another car!!! We proceeded to pay for the luwak coffee and leave with spending any more money!!!",1,2020-03-07
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,"This place is great, ok it feels quite touristic but the view is really nice and the installation is great for you to have your nice Bali memory shot,Its a great experience",4,2020-02-25
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,We did the main jungle swing and it was SOOOO fun.  The pictures from it are incredible.  You can rent a dress from them that is long and flowy for cheap.  It fits most sizes.  I would highly recommend coming here and renting the dress!,5,2020-02-18
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,"Attentive staff, good concept, can see padi terrace up close. Great place for those who love posing for pictures. Kids enjoyed it. Good explanation on luwak coffee provided. The coffee itself is expensive compared to outside. Can’t vouch for the taste.",4,2020-01-26
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,Good fun for all the family. A variety of swings at different levels so fits all peoples tastes. Also has a aerial bicycle on wires and a zip line over the shallow valley. Various other small walking tracks and places to take those essential selfies. Lewat Coffee tasting also available.A good way to spend an hour or so.,4,2020-01-23
ubud,Terrace_River_Pool_Swing,"This is the perfect place to spend one morning during your vacation while you’re in  Bali.You can ride the big swing of around 35 m above the the floor,It really gives you some adrenaline ,you can also and be amazed by the surrounding area, by the terraces and some other things to do like riding a bike 20 m above the floor.Try to go as early as you can to avoid crowds.If you are a coffe lover, you’ll find a little surprise.",5,2020-01-05
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"The main reason to visit was the Bali Swings which is part of the coffee plantation.We had the tour of the small plantation, sampled the various teas and drank the Luwak coffee which is reputedly to be very expensive. We just shared one cup. Tasted like Nescafe to me once you put milk and sugar in.There is a popular gift shop where you can buy the various teas and coffees. However Bali has no shortage of these types of shops and I can never vouch for the genuineness of the Luwak coffee beans.Once the tasting was done, we went to the swings. That is what the kids wanted to do and we also had a nice stroll around the area.",4,2020-04-21
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"... Other than that this place is a Must to visit.Not just a tea and coffee plantation tourist centre but one with a difference!Allegedly £75 a cup in some London venues you could be quite correct in calling it crxp. It's that coffee made from the coffee beans eaten by a local furry critter, passed, separated, skin removed and then called the rarest coffee in the world.After free tastes of 13 of their coffees, teas and hot chocolates, I had no qualms about spending a couple of pounds on this, £73 well saved. So mild as to be bland. Obviously personal taste. A great place and great staff with great t shirts.",5,2020-03-24
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,This was a wonderful tour that gave us a great overview of how coffee is grown and processed in Bali. The guides are excellent and can answer any questions you may have. The tours are informative but reasonable in length giving plenty of time for tasting the different coffees and teas from the area. Highly recommend this as a stop on your visit to Bali!,5,2020-03-12
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I didn’t expect this to be as good as it was, even the kids who are 11 and 13 absolutely loved it which was surprising!",4,2020-03-08
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,What a great visit this was learning about the local coffees being made and tasting them especially the  most expensive coffee in the world the luwak coffee  made from the poo of the luwak animal which are actually  on the plantation.If you want to visit here or any other place in Bali we met and used a brilliant taxi driver and guide called DEKRIT of brotherhood bali tours who took us lots of places in a day for a very reasonable price call him on +6281337295848 or email at gedesubrata47@gmail.com he also picked us up and returned us to airport great guy and speaks very good English use him you will not be disappointed,4,2020-03-07
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,Great experience! Must try the coffee!!! Locals are very nice and explain how the coffee is made and what they do to get it to drinking stage.,5,2020-02-25
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"Worthwhile seeing the coffee plantation it was informative,  i dont drink coffee but trying all the teas was great",5,2020-02-23
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I went to this location and it’s beautiful! They have swings here, I felt safe and the staff is very kind. They took the best pictures btw! The cost for the swings were approximately 250K IDR. The coffee plantation part was beautiful as well. I did not feel pressured to buy anything and the tasting was free. It also wasn’t crowded, which is a plus!",5,2020-02-14
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"The tour was decent and the lady that works there was friendly, and you get a lot of free coffee and tea to try, that’s the only reason I can’t give a one star. Besides that, I honestly think all of the coffee is fake. There are very little coffee plantations and the place is very small. Also it was very disappointing to find out that the coffee we bought has nothing to do with the coffee we tried there, and it is VERY expensive! It is just a mixture of very average coffee mixed with a lot of sugar, and the 2 spoons per 150ml is not even closely enough. Oh yea, I should probably mention you can get it for way cheaper anywhere in Ubud.Very bad tourist trap, don’t go there!!! (Or at least DO NOT BUY ANYTHING, you can go there just to try some coffee for free if you wish!)",2,2020-02-02
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I don't know where to start. Maybe it's the falsely labelled ""organic dark chocolate"" which when I bit into at home was basically palm oil and some Quik cocoa powder. Maybe it's the overpriced ""Luwak"" coffee that tasted like Nescafe and creamer gone bad (I'm almost sure it did not come from the poor civet cats they had on-site). Maybe the grumpy employee who literally was the only unfriendly local we met in all of Bali. Guaranteed nothing is authentic or as advertised here (including all the fake good reviews here!) It pains me to think this fraud is rolling in the money like we saw at their store, taking away from honest local businesses. Avoid like the plague when your driver insists on stopping here (because of kickbacks).",1,2020-01-16
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"This is a tourist trap. It’s most unlikely it is even a coffee plantation or do any of their own processing or roasting.  There were scattered plants of random native fruit trees and robustas coffee plants but no arabica in sight. 1st red flag.  Everyone is assigned a personal guide to explain about the Luwak cats, their harvesting methods and traditional roasting.  It is very scenic and beautiful with the valley and vegetation surrounding you but don’t let this fool you, calling this a plantation is a real stretch. I didn’t see more than 5 coffee plants and less than 10 cats in total. There’s no way they would be able to produce anything on a commercial level supplying the souvenir store with their product.  This place is more for taking pictures (swing and nest extra$)and Instagramming your experience, and I’m almost 100% sure tour companies and drivers get a kick back from bringing in visitors.  The biggest joke of all was their free samples of coffee.  Everything tasted like heavily sugared watered down instant coffee. Worst than tassimo or any of those junk coffee pods.  If you want good coffee or maybe just decent coffee, there are plenty, PLENTY of wonderful espresso bars all over Ubud that take coffee seriously.  I ended up purchasing the avocado coffee and dark chocolate out of guilt for the free tour and samples they provided us. Upon arriving home, I opened up both products to try. Neither product was edible. The coffee had specks of instant coffee granules in a mountain of powdered creamer and the chocolate tasted nothing like chocolate, more like a bar of palm oil. Also both products did not list their ingredients. Red flag #2.  I would have been so embarrassed had I gifted these as souvenirs.  Everything in their store was astronomically over inflated, I feel duped and cheated.",1,2020-01-14
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I visited the plantation onky because the driver that we rebted added it into our Day plan, So did not mind it as it was suppsed to be Just an additional stop. The whole experinece  was ok until i first bought teas and Coffee there and then realized how Overpriced luwak Coffee they sell. They sell a pack of 250g at 1.1mln where you can buy it at the Airport for not more than 400k idr. The second disappointment was at home when we finally opened the packets and realized that the teas consists of powder- a mixture of sugar and flavour. Really disappoiting. I spent ca. 130 EUR and feel like an idiot. Do n o t make the same mistakes. Do not buy there anything.",1,2020-01-14
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"I expected a representation of the most important Balinese art trends. After visiting Arma Museum, I had high hopes. To my disappointment, the paintings are ""tourist"" oriented, fast made copies, often representing the same themes, colors, etc. To be honest, the same types can be found back home sold to tourist. The hosts were not pleasant either. Luckily, I decided to walk there from Ubud since I had a lot of free time and stumbled on the way back upon a house of a local artist that is located on the road when leaving Ubud - wow - that was amazing in comparison. A genuine Balinese artist's home of I Gusti Putu Sana. Not only I had a chance to walk around his family home, got invited for coffee and could experience the genuine Balinese art. This was a true gem.  Forget this cooperative, I bet there are more hidden gems like that around.",1,2020-05-16
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"We usually take years to find paintings that we both like and suit what we are looking for. However here we were spoilt for choice. There was such a range of styles to choose from and so many galleries, that we found many that we both liked. So, rather than having difficulty choosing a painting, our decision was solely determined by the size of the painting. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2020-03-17
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"Surrounded by vibrant, colorful and detailed paintings of all kinds, this artists cooperative will not disappoint. It is brimming with pieces that reflect life in Bali; many layered scenes of life, respect for culture and the natural world. There are paintings of every size and for every budget. Magnificent.",5,2020-03-12
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"We recently bought 2 paintings from here. We originally saw one painting at a gallery in downtown Ubud, then decided to pop into this place to compare what we wanted. Thank god we did, the downtown gallery was charging nearly double for the same artist's (different but similar) painting. The funds from your purchase here go to the collective of over 150 artists, we got 2 really special pieces of art instead of one since the variety and selection was so vast, for less than the price of the 1 we found downtown, what's not to love about that?! They made it easy to transport back to Canada, the whole transaction was smooth and everyone walked away happy. I'd highly recommend Semar Kuning even just for a visit, but if you're looking for some special art to take home this place is absolutely worth a visit.",5,2020-01-31
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"As part of our tour through Ubud, we found ourselves deep in the commercial end of town (by the Monkey Forest) which is where the Puri Saren Royal Palace lies. If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that. Not an essential stop by any means, but if you want more of that Balinese architectural goodness then you can easily fit it into your schedule.",3,2020-09-07
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"When you hear ""Ubud Palce"", you're expecting something magical and grand. Don't expect this to be like Buckingham Palace. I had read up about the history of the palace before I came, this was lucky because unless you have a tour guide, there isn't much facts about the past. It is free entry. And there is only a few courtyards and that's it. You can't go into some sacred areas. It can be a quick walk around. If you're looking at getting some good photos, i suggest visiting first thing in the morning, as there is always crowds.",4,2020-03-08
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"The feeling of a palace or a traditional landmark is a bit lost... maybe because it is located at downtown and the ""modern"" city is growing around it.",3,2020-02-26
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"It's an important landmark and free to enter. There are locals dancing on the stage for practice when we were there during the day which was cute to see. If you're in Ubud, you should come snap a picture but don't expect much of a ""palace""",3,2020-01-29
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,Worth the price - see the maestro's collection. No camera's are allowed one you enter the museum. Worth to visit for about an hour.,4,2021-09-29
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"Magnificent paintings and beyond…sadly the museum needs a bit more loving care.  Beautiful collection of Don Antonio Blanco’s paintings and wood sculptures.  Depicting his love to his wife Ni Rondji who was his muse in most of his paintings. The museum is built in European design to house majority of the paintings, while the studio is a traditional Balinese country home.  Very large area with beautiful garden.  Museum area needs more care by putting more lights so visitors can admire Blanco’s creation.",3,2021-09-27

ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"The gardens were absolutely beautiful and the real selling point of the museum, containing tropical birds and stunning flowers. The building is a really interesting shape and an insight into the theatrics of Antonio, he was frequently compared to Dali and visiting this museum it's clear to see why those comparisons might have been made. The art itself mostly consisted of breasts, lots and lots of breasts, Antonio believed that Indonesian women had the best breasts in the world and boy did he go to the effort of trying to prove it.",4,2020-06-24
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,We were lucky enough to have a partially engaged tour. The guide revealed unusual things that we would have otherwise missed. Amazing out of the ordinary museum. Don’t miss picture with the birds!,5,2020-04-13
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"I can only say that I would have loved to meet Don Antonio Blanco in person...an exceptional artist with creativity to spare. His paintings express his love an reverance for the female form for Balinese culture with a healthy dose of 'tongue-in-cheek' humor woven into his many paintings. The frames of each painting are part of Blanco's explosive creativity; filled with detail, hand crafted and designed to highlight the form and intent of each piece. The building itself with painted floors, walls, stairs and golden staturary adornig exterior balconies are the perfect venue for his work. Walking through his studio as you prepare to exit is a special gift.",5,2020-03-12
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"This so called ""museum"" is nothing more then a homage to the ego of a vainglorious man daring to compare himself to Salvador Dali. The most expensive museum 100,00 Idr. There is nothing but his own art and photo ops with the stars. The building which is called the museum would even challenge Liberace's taste.                                           DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1,2020-02-18
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"I had high expectations, having been to other one-off places in the region (eg Manila, Saigon) that were genuinely exciting.  Well, this is not really all that much.  Blanco was a competent artist, and a quirky, egocentric fellow, clearly much loved by his family, and happily wealthy.  But as good as all that is -- and who would begrudge any of it? -- being a wealthy egoist, loved by the family, is not actually adequate ground to open a public gallery.",3,2020-01-15
ubud,Gunung_Lebah_Temple,"Turn to Ibah's Warwick resort, and you'll find a local school to park your car/bike. From there, follow the path to go to Campuhan, and you'll find the Temple at the side of your walk. it's mostly closed and opened only for praying. Still, you can take shots in front of the temple gate.",4,2021-09-29
ubud,Gunung_Lebah_Temple,I found it walking down the street.  when I got closer I saw a family doing a ritual there.  it was the most beautiful and colorful site I have seen.  The experience made me very emotional.  they all were very respectful and,5,2020-07-28

ubud,Subak_Juwuk_Manis_Ubud_Rice_Field,This was great! We saw maybe three other tourists the whole walk. Feels very rural but it's in the middle of Ubud. Very Easy walk. Quite pretty. Very hot and humid but that's Ubud for you. Quite Picturesque if you enjoy taking photos.,5,2020-02-22
ubud,Museum_Puri_Lukisan,"Beautiful local arts are presented here. Place is not very big itself but was interesting to visit, once we stay in Ubud we really like to feel the atmosphere of the area. And museum Puri Lukisan is one of the places we really enjoyed.",5,2020-11-10
ubud,Museum_Puri_Lukisan,"Museum Puri Lukisan is a tranquil place of serenity and home to some great artworks. You can go around the museum and enjoy the majestic Balinese architecture with its cultivated garden, beautiful ponds and big halls filled with Hindu's sacred artworks. It is one of the oldest art museums in Bali, founded and build by Tjokorda Gde Agung Sukawati (the king of Ubud), his brother, Walter Spies and Rudolf Bonnet. The story of Ramayana and Mahabharata are the main subject for most of the paintings and sculptures. The battle of good versus evil, the romance between the mortals and immortal are all depicted in various techniques by different artists. There are also artworks by Walter Spies of Balinese landscape. All are available for intercultural contemplation for both the physical and spiritual.",4,2020-07-26

ubud,Museum_Puri_Lukisan,"This museum is only just up the road from the Ubud palace. There is a sign at the front so you can't miss it. There is an entrance fee which you pay to on the right before you head up the stairs. Up the top of the stairs there is a beautiful garden. Then each building has a different art exhibition inside. Was great to see some traditional Indonesian art inside. There is no photography allowed inside these buildings. There also appeared to be a cafe up the top too.Apparently you can get a free glass of juice afterwards, but I didn't know where to get one from.",4,2020-03-08

ubud,Supermarket_Bintang,You have the right to return an item that is not what is advertised and expect polite service . Yesterday i was accused of buying and item elsewhere and returning it to Bintang when i was standing there with the receipt I was made to feel a liar when it was obviously the item was bought from Bintang. I had no problem with it being exchanged for the correct item which eventually they didn’t have but no the manager couldn’t just say sorry for the inconvenience and sort it out without a belittling condescending accusing attitude .

ubud,Supermarket_Bintang,"This supermarket got everything I need to fixed our lunch and dinners. They have a lot of selection of meat and seafood. Good varieties of fresh fruits and vegetables also. One thing I loved is they have a lot of souvenir items you can buy without going to the flea market and try to bargain. Here, prices are pretty much comparable to the market price. Cashiers are very helpful and friendly. Make sure you bring your own eco bag if you are shopping in Bali. Plastic bags are thing in the past. They are serious in saving the environment.

I wanted to buy some items so i went to their facebook page to ask if they had the items in stock as they were more of a gift line not a necessity, i was told only in the Ubud store but if i wanted to order they would bring the stock down to the pop up shop for me, so i placed my order and said i was flying out the next morning and asked what time could i pick the items up only to be told they would deliver the items to me free of charge, you could not ask for better sevice.

You’ll see full of details dragon statue on the stairs to main entrance, then you’ll find ticket counter, then the magic begins. The museum has huge variation of arts on display. It has 3 storeys on the main building, and few other smaller bungalows around it. Yes, they’re all full of paintings and arts.

ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I had the amazing opportunity of experiencing one of Alex's online/offline teacher training courses.What a profound and beautiful experience it was 🙏🏻🙌🏻. Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives. And we are finding it every day 🙂🦋🙏🏻.Thank you Alex, peace and love to you brother 🙏🏻☀️",5,2021-09-28

I did not have any desire to teach but wanted to learn more about breathing and improve my practice. Boy was it packed with information,fun and amazing speakers from all overt the world. It was very impressive and Alex went beyond what i was expecting and delivered many many techniques and practices that were mind blowing.He has also created a wonderful community of before and after participants to communicate with on a regular basis whether is just exchanging information of running online sessions with the group its a fabulous continuation of the course.I highly recommend this teacher training as Alex puts his heart and soul into the program.Warmly,Johnny ( Owner Bali Eco Stay )",5,2021-09-17
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I did Alex’ teacher training and it was such a powerful and amazing experience. I met people that ended up becoming some of my best friends and I am very grateful for my decision to participate. The training opened up my eyes to not only the breath and the ice, but to the possibilities and capabilities I have within myself and how I can share this with others. There were many interesting speakers and facilitators showing their own style and I felt encouraged to also find my own breath and what works for me. If you want to teach or not, the training is a beautiful opportunity to connect with yourself and other people. Alex creates a space of acceptance and openness that made it possible to push my own comfort zone and inspired me to follow my heart. After the training I am still in close contact with the group and with Alex and we continue to learn from each other and encourage and support.",5,2021-05-31

This was made possible by Alex who is a master in holding space and facilitating an environment where people can learn about themselves and each other. During the training, we learned from other experts who were invited to share their knowledge and experience from being a breath work teacher or any expertise related to the breath.Thanks to the classed presented by Alex along with the other experts, we gained the knowledge and confidence to organize our own breath work session for a group. We learned how to facilitate and icebath and a group session, by doing it ourselves and receiving critical but at the same time very supportive feedback. Thank you for this amazing experience, Alex!",5,2021-05-23

ubud,Breathing_Cold,"Being a breathwork coach myself I had an immersive pleasure being in several workshops created by Alex, including the latest teacher training program. Alex is a master of creating experiences that I will remember my whole life. Experiences that taught me so much about myself and reminded me every step of the way that I'm just a human, with all that comes with it. And it's ok! It's all ok. Learning to be comfortable in my own skin, emotions and thoughts and understanding how to communicate with all of that. This approach hugely resonated with me, because this is exactly how I wanted to work with people and just didnt understand how at the moment. Alex brings out confidence through teaching freedom and independence, support and motivation. He is very transparent with what he teaches, feels and goes through himself, allowing the participants of his workshops to be just that: individuals on purpose with purpose! Highly recommend to be around him for as much as possible if you want to learn how to freely be your true self and shine your gifts onto others!",5,2020-07-14

I arrived on the first day feeling unsure about life and my path. After just three days of Breathing Cold, I truly felt a deep shift in myself, one of clarity and success.This is the best use of time and money I have ever used.

I have been living in Bali for 2 years now an it was definitely one of the best experiences I have had on the island. Alex is an incredible teacher and really holds space for everyone, paying close attention to the specific needs of the participants and creating a safe space for connection and transformation. This workshop was about so much more than ice baths! I feel I got a much deeper understanding of my own psychology around fear and discomfort and began to shift some big energy in my life. The workshop was a few days ago and I'm still feeling the profound effects of this experience.  I highly , highly, recommend!",5,2020-02-09
ubud,Breathing_Cold,This day was mind blowing not only for me but everyone who came to this special workshop!Alex has so much knowledge! The morning is about breathing and ice bath. During the ice bath Alex has been very supportive I was scared and he even stayed in a bath with me holding my hands all a long. Thank you so much for that coz i am not sure I would have gone without your help!And I decided to stay for the afternoon part which was wonderful no words can describe.I will definitely try again the experience.See you soon!Alexandra,5,2020-02-04

You will learn the power of cold therapy and breathing techniques to enhance your life and help you to be  mentally stronger.  I was nervous and anxious at first but it didn't take long for me to feel completely comfortable within the tranquil surroundings, and in the company of Alex and the other great people in my group. Lunch is delicious and healthy and the visit to the waterfall is a something truly special. This workshop is better than excellent.

Alex does an amazing job of guiding everyone threw the experiences in a caring, safe and fun way! It really gave me a well needed boost in letting go of experiences and habits that don't serve me anymore and welcome in new healthier happy ones. Definitely recommend this day for anybody who wants to learn valuable lessons in handling stress/well-being and explore their connection with themselves and others!",5,2020-01-11
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I would definatley reccommend doing this workshop early on your Ubud stay. The workshop encompasses so much more than just breathing and ice baths! Without giving too much away, great food and interesting places are all part of the experience, and the extra activities are things you would want to or should do anyway. So get them all with Alex!",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This workshop was incredible. I’ve never done breath work and am beyond blessed this was my first experience. I found Alex was crazy insightful about the science behind the breathwork and then I felt at ease being guided in the work with him and the crew. I’ve been a TM meditator for 3 years and have done yoga for 6 but, believe that this breath work is the quickest way to process and release the trauma stored in the body. 3 weeks later I still have done this simple but helpful breath work every day. The ice cold plunge was an incredible high, it woke up my body, helped me deal with some of the fear. I was impressed everyone in the group stuck in it. Lastly, we were taken to this beautiful sanctuary in the rainforest. I don’t want to give too much away about it for others who go on this trip but the waterfalls and the cave was so beautiful and spiritually healing for me.  I really felt opened up, alive, warm And am beyond grateful for this journey. Ps- I never post reviews online. That is how much this experience has moved me and how much I want to give back in any way I can to it. Best,Blaine",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This was amazing. I didn’t know what to expect prior to attending, so I was very nervous at the start. Alex was very understanding, managed to make me feel very comfortable and allowed me to go at my own pace. When I faced the challenges such as holding breath and getting into the ice bath Alex was very supportive and made me feel at ease. We finished the day by going to a secret secret temple in the mountains which was a life changing experience! So much nature beauty it’s almost overwhelming. Thank you Alex for a wonderful day. I have learnt a lot about myself and look forward to implementing new techniques I have learnt. One more thing that I feel I should share, is my breathing exercise experience. Having a broken nose I have accepted that my breathing will never be great. During the exercise, I managed to hold my breath for 4 mins!!! I surprised myself! The body sensation I felt during was pure relaxation and absolute bliss. It made me realise how great breathing can feel. Definitely something I will be doing daily.",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This experience was life changing in so many ways, and I am so grateful for Alex’s constant support and guidance, the level of enlightenment was beyond what I was expecting. Definitely one of the best days I’ve spent in Bali 🙏🏻",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"It was an amazing one day with Alex, A life changing experience. He taught us so many breathing techniques and then guided us into the biggest challenge of our lives which was being immersed in an ice bath. He was supportive compassionate and a true leader guiding us through out the whole experience. I loved every moment of it. We ended the day by going to a secret location filled with beautiful temples and amazing waterfalls. It was out of this world. Thank you Alex. The girls and I loved it. See you again !!",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,Amazing work from Alex to put together motivational and educative content to grow through this learning experience.,5,2020-01-06
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I am posting this review to inform other people who maybe thinking about going to this retreat. Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it. You can see all the things we've mentioned in his instagram page as proof of our experience . Very very cult like and disturbing .Research and learn for yourselves. Be safe",1,2020-01-06
ubud,Wayan_Gama_Painter_Group_and_School,"This is the perfect art gallery where they teach the traditional small detailed drawing, which might take months to finish. They also tour you around the house and tell about traditional balinese houses. The professional paintings were costly (hundreds and thousands), but you can get students' works cheaply. I'm not sure whether the prices are just prices where you should start bargaining or not.",4,2020-01-17
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"The main reason to visit was the Bali Swings which is part of the coffee plantation.We had the tour of the small plantation, sampled the various teas and drank the Luwak coffee which is reputedly to be very expensive. We just shared one cup. Tasted like Nescafe to me once you put milk and sugar in.There is a popular gift shop where you can buy the various teas and coffees. However Bali has no shortage of these types of shops and I can never vouch for the genuineness of the Luwak coffee beans.Once the tasting was done, we went to the swings. That is what the kids wanted to do and we also had a nice stroll around the area.",4,2020-04-21
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"... Other than that this place is a Must to visit.Not just a tea and coffee plantation tourist centre but one with a difference!Allegedly £75 a cup in some London venues you could be quite correct in calling it crxp. It's that coffee made from the coffee beans eaten by a local furry critter, passed, separated, skin removed and then called the rarest coffee in the world.After free tastes of 13 of their coffees, teas and hot chocolates, I had no qualms about spending a couple of pounds on this, £73 well saved. So mild as to be bland. Obviously personal taste. A great place and great staff with great t shirts.",5,2020-03-24
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,This was a wonderful tour that gave us a great overview of how coffee is grown and processed in Bali. The guides are excellent and can answer any questions you may have. The tours are informative but reasonable in length giving plenty of time for tasting the different coffees and teas from the area. Highly recommend this as a stop on your visit to Bali!,5,2020-03-12
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I didn’t expect this to be as good as it was, even the kids who are 11 and 13 absolutely loved it which was surprising!",4,2020-03-08
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,What a great visit this was learning about the local coffees being made and tasting them especially the  most expensive coffee in the world the luwak coffee  made from the poo of the luwak animal which are actually  on the plantation.If you want to visit here or any other place in Bali we met and used a brilliant taxi driver and guide called DEKRIT of brotherhood bali tours who took us lots of places in a day for a very reasonable price call him on +6281337295848 or email at gedesubrata47@gmail.com he also picked us up and returned us to airport great guy and speaks very good English use him you will not be disappointed,4,2020-03-07
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,Great experience! Must try the coffee!!! Locals are very nice and explain how the coffee is made and what they do to get it to drinking stage.,5,2020-02-25
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"Worthwhile seeing the coffee plantation it was informative,  i dont drink coffee but trying all the teas was great",5,2020-02-23
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I went to this location and it’s beautiful! They have swings here, I felt safe and the staff is very kind. They took the best pictures btw! The cost for the swings were approximately 250K IDR. The coffee plantation part was beautiful as well. I did not feel pressured to buy anything and the tasting was free. It also wasn’t crowded, which is a plus!",5,2020-02-14
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"The tour was decent and the lady that works there was friendly, and you get a lot of free coffee and tea to try, that’s the only reason I can’t give a one star. Besides that, I honestly think all of the coffee is fake. There are very little coffee plantations and the place is very small. Also it was very disappointing to find out that the coffee we bought has nothing to do with the coffee we tried there, and it is VERY expensive! It is just a mixture of very average coffee mixed with a lot of sugar, and the 2 spoons per 150ml is not even closely enough. Oh yea, I should probably mention you can get it for way cheaper anywhere in Ubud.Very bad tourist trap, don’t go there!!! (Or at least DO NOT BUY ANYTHING, you can go there just to try some coffee for free if you wish!)",2,2020-02-02
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I don't know where to start. Maybe it's the falsely labelled ""organic dark chocolate"" which when I bit into at home was basically palm oil and some Quik cocoa powder. Maybe it's the overpriced ""Luwak"" coffee that tasted like Nescafe and creamer gone bad (I'm almost sure it did not come from the poor civet cats they had on-site). Maybe the grumpy employee who literally was the only unfriendly local we met in all of Bali. Guaranteed nothing is authentic or as advertised here (including all the fake good reviews here!) It pains me to think this fraud is rolling in the money like we saw at their store, taking away from honest local businesses. Avoid like the plague when your driver insists on stopping here (because of kickbacks).",1,2020-01-16
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"This is a tourist trap. It’s most unlikely it is even a coffee plantation or do any of their own processing or roasting.  There were scattered plants of random native fruit trees and robustas coffee plants but no arabica in sight. 1st red flag.  Everyone is assigned a personal guide to explain about the Luwak cats, their harvesting methods and traditional roasting.  It is very scenic and beautiful with the valley and vegetation surrounding you but don’t let this fool you, calling this a plantation is a real stretch. I didn’t see more than 5 coffee plants and less than 10 cats in total. There’s no way they would be able to produce anything on a commercial level supplying the souvenir store with their product.  This place is more for taking pictures (swing and nest extra$)and Instagramming your experience, and I’m almost 100% sure tour companies and drivers get a kick back from bringing in visitors.  The biggest joke of all was their free samples of coffee.  Everything tasted like heavily sugared watered down instant coffee. Worst than tassimo or any of those junk coffee pods.  If you want good coffee or maybe just decent coffee, there are plenty, PLENTY of wonderful espresso bars all over Ubud that take coffee seriously.  I ended up purchasing the avocado coffee and dark chocolate out of guilt for the free tour and samples they provided us. Upon arriving home, I opened up both products to try. Neither product was edible. The coffee had specks of instant coffee granules in a mountain of powdered creamer and the chocolate tasted nothing like chocolate, more like a bar of palm oil. Also both products did not list their ingredients. Red flag #2.  I would have been so embarrassed had I gifted these as souvenirs.  Everything in their store was astronomically over inflated, I feel duped and cheated.",1,2020-01-14
ubud,Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"I visited the plantation onky because the driver that we rebted added it into our Day plan, So did not mind it as it was suppsed to be Just an additional stop. The whole experinece  was ok until i first bought teas and Coffee there and then realized how Overpriced luwak Coffee they sell. They sell a pack of 250g at 1.1mln where you can buy it at the Airport for not more than 400k idr. The second disappointment was at home when we finally opened the packets and realized that the teas consists of powder- a mixture of sugar and flavour. Really disappoiting. I spent ca. 130 EUR and feel like an idiot. Do n o t make the same mistakes. Do not buy there anything.",1,2020-01-14
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"I expected a representation of the most important Balinese art trends. After visiting Arma Museum, I had high hopes. To my disappointment, the paintings are ""tourist"" oriented, fast made copies, often representing the same themes, colors, etc. To be honest, the same types can be found back home sold to tourist. The hosts were not pleasant either. Luckily, I decided to walk there from Ubud since I had a lot of free time and stumbled on the way back upon a house of a local artist that is located on the road when leaving Ubud - wow - that was amazing in comparison. A genuine Balinese artist's home of I Gusti Putu Sana. Not only I had a chance to walk around his family home, got invited for coffee and could experience the genuine Balinese art. This was a true gem.  Forget this cooperative, I bet there are more hidden gems like that around.",1,2020-05-16
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"We usually take years to find paintings that we both like and suit what we are looking for. However here we were spoilt for choice. There was such a range of styles to choose from and so many galleries, that we found many that we both liked. So, rather than having difficulty choosing a painting, our decision was solely determined by the size of the painting. Thoroughly recommended.",5,2020-03-17
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"Surrounded by vibrant, colorful and detailed paintings of all kinds, this artists cooperative will not disappoint. It is brimming with pieces that reflect life in Bali; many layered scenes of life, respect for culture and the natural world. There are paintings of every size and for every budget. Magnificent.",5,2020-03-12
ubud,Semar_Kuning_Artist_Cooperative,"We recently bought 2 paintings from here. We originally saw one painting at a gallery in downtown Ubud, then decided to pop into this place to compare what we wanted. Thank god we did, the downtown gallery was charging nearly double for the same artist's (different but similar) painting. The funds from your purchase here go to the collective of over 150 artists, we got 2 really special pieces of art instead of one since the variety and selection was so vast, for less than the price of the 1 we found downtown, what's not to love about that?! They made it easy to transport back to Canada, the whole transaction was smooth and everyone walked away happy. I'd highly recommend Semar Kuning even just for a visit, but if you're looking for some special art to take home this place is absolutely worth a visit.",5,2020-01-31
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"As part of our tour through Ubud, we found ourselves deep in the commercial end of town (by the Monkey Forest) which is where the Puri Saren Royal Palace lies. If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that. Not an essential stop by any means, but if you want more of that Balinese architectural goodness then you can easily fit it into your schedule.",3,2020-09-07
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"When you hear ""Ubud Palce"", you're expecting something magical and grand. Don't expect this to be like Buckingham Palace. I had read up about the history of the palace before I came, this was lucky because unless you have a tour guide, there isn't much facts about the past. It is free entry. And there is only a few courtyards and that's it. You can't go into some sacred areas. It can be a quick walk around. If you're looking at getting some good photos, i suggest visiting first thing in the morning, as there is always crowds.",4,2020-03-08
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"The feeling of a palace or a traditional landmark is a bit lost... maybe because it is located at downtown and the ""modern"" city is growing around it.",3,2020-02-26
ubud,Puri_Saren_Palace,"It's an important landmark and free to enter. There are locals dancing on the stage for practice when we were there during the day which was cute to see. If you're in Ubud, you should come snap a picture but don't expect much of a ""palace""",3,2020-01-29
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,Worth the price - see the maestro's collection. No camera's are allowed one you enter the museum. Worth to visit for about an hour.,4,2021-09-29
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"Magnificent paintings and beyond…sadly the museum needs a bit more loving care.  Beautiful collection of Don Antonio Blanco’s paintings and wood sculptures.  Depicting his love to his wife Ni Rondji who was his muse in most of his paintings. The museum is built in European design to house majority of the paintings, while the studio is a traditional Balinese country home.  Very large area with beautiful garden.  Museum area needs more care by putting more lights so visitors can admire Blanco’s creation.",3,2021-09-27

ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"The gardens were absolutely beautiful and the real selling point of the museum, containing tropical birds and stunning flowers. The building is a really interesting shape and an insight into the theatrics of Antonio, he was frequently compared to Dali and visiting this museum it's clear to see why those comparisons might have been made. The art itself mostly consisted of breasts, lots and lots of breasts, Antonio believed that Indonesian women had the best breasts in the world and boy did he go to the effort of trying to prove it.",4,2020-06-24
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,We were lucky enough to have a partially engaged tour. The guide revealed unusual things that we would have otherwise missed. Amazing out of the ordinary museum. Don’t miss picture with the birds!,5,2020-04-13
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"I can only say that I would have loved to meet Don Antonio Blanco in person...an exceptional artist with creativity to spare. His paintings express his love an reverance for the female form for Balinese culture with a healthy dose of 'tongue-in-cheek' humor woven into his many paintings. The frames of each painting are part of Blanco's explosive creativity; filled with detail, hand crafted and designed to highlight the form and intent of each piece. The building itself with painted floors, walls, stairs and golden staturary adornig exterior balconies are the perfect venue for his work. Walking through his studio as you prepare to exit is a special gift.",5,2020-03-12
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"This so called ""museum"" is nothing more then a homage to the ego of a vainglorious man daring to compare himself to Salvador Dali. The most expensive museum 100,00 Idr. There is nothing but his own art and photo ops with the stars. The building which is called the museum would even challenge Liberace's taste.                                           DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1,2020-02-18
ubud,Don_Antonio_Blanco_Museum,"I had high expectations, having been to other one-off places in the region (eg Manila, Saigon) that were genuinely exciting.  Well, this is not really all that much.  Blanco was a competent artist, and a quirky, egocentric fellow, clearly much loved by his family, and happily wealthy.  But as good as all that is -- and who would begrudge any of it? -- being a wealthy egoist, loved by the family, is not actually adequate ground to open a public gallery.",3,2020-01-15

Still, you can take shots in front of the temple gate.",4,2021-09-29

The story of Ramayana and Mahabharata are the main subject for most of the paintings and sculptures. The battle of good versus evil, the romance between the mortals and immortal are all depicted in various techniques by different artists.

There is an entrance fee which you pay to on the right before you head up the stairs. Up the top of the stairs there is a beautiful garden. Then each building has a different art exhibition inside. Was great to see some traditional Indonesian art inside. There is no photography allowed inside these buildings. There also appeared to be a cafe up the top too.Apparently you can get a free glass of juice afterwards, but I didn't know where to get one from.",4,2020-03-08

Cashiers are very helpful and friendly. Make sure you bring your own eco bag if you are shopping in Bali. Plastic bags are thing in the past. They are serious in saving the environment.

The temple itself is tiny, small and not well maintained. 30k IDR access fee with free sarong included. 500m walk from parking by a nice rice paddies area, but not recommended if is to hot! Kinndly but strong refuse the locals who offer to show you the place, I heard them with a group speaking no English, no history questions answer, but high tip expected. Discover the place by yourself.",4,2020-01-30
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I had the amazing opportunity of experiencing one of Alex's online/offline teacher training courses.What a profound and beautiful experience it was 🙏🏻🙌🏻. Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives. And we are finding it every day 🙂🦋🙏🏻.Thank you Alex, peace and love to you brother 🙏🏻☀️",5,2021-09-28
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I participated in Alex's third teacher training in February of this year with off line for 3 weeks at Swasti Eco Cottages and 3 weeks online at home. I did not have any desire to teach but wanted to learn more about breathing and improve my practice. Boy was it packed with information,fun and amazing speakers from all overt the world. It was very impressive and Alex went beyond what i was expecting and delivered many many techniques and practices that were mind blowing.He has also created a wonderful community of before and after participants to communicate with on a regular basis whether is just exchanging information of running online sessions with the group its a fabulous continuation of the course.I highly recommend this teacher training as Alex puts his heart and soul into the program.Warmly,Johnny ( Owner Bali Eco Stay )",5,2021-09-17
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I did Alex’ teacher training and it was such a powerful and amazing experience. I met people that ended up becoming some of my best friends and I am very grateful for my decision to participate. The training opened up my eyes to not only the breath and the ice, but to the possibilities and capabilities I have within myself and how I can share this with others. There were many interesting speakers and facilitators showing their own style and I felt encouraged to also find my own breath and what works for me. If you want to teach or not, the training is a beautiful opportunity to connect with yourself and other people. Alex creates a space of acceptance and openness that made it possible to push my own comfort zone and inspired me to follow my heart. After the training I am still in close contact with the group and with Alex and we continue to learn from each other and encourage and support.",5,2021-05-31
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I participated in a 6-week breathwork teacher training which was an amazing experience. On personal development I made a lot of growth with the help of the entire group. This was made possible by Alex who is a master in holding space and facilitating an environment where people can learn about themselves and each other. During the training, we learned from other experts who were invited to share their knowledge and experience from being a breath work teacher or any expertise related to the breath.Thanks to the classed presented by Alex along with the other experts, we gained the knowledge and confidence to organize our own breath work session for a group. We learned how to facilitate and icebath and a group session, by doing it ourselves and receiving critical but at the same time very supportive feedback. Thank you for this amazing experience, Alex!",5,2021-05-23
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I have participated in the Breathing Cold Teacher Training and loved it! Alex is excellent at creating a safe container using his Authentic Relating Skills. Thanks to that our whole group could go so deep which built trust amongst us and therefor let me fully surrender into the training. I gained so much confidence in my facilitation skills, built friendships for life and let me embody my daily breathwork practice. I can highly recommend participating in this training as it is life changing!",5,2021-05-12

ubud,Breathing_Cold,"Being a breathwork coach myself I had an immersive pleasure being in several workshops created by Alex, including the latest teacher training program. Alex is a master of creating experiences that I will remember my whole life. Experiences that taught me so much about myself and reminded me every step of the way that I'm just a human, with all that comes with it. And it's ok! It's all ok. Learning to be comfortable in my own skin, emotions and thoughts and understanding how to communicate with all of that. This approach hugely resonated with me, because this is exactly how I wanted to work with people and just didnt understand how at the moment. Alex brings out confidence through teaching freedom and independence, support and motivation. He is very transparent with what he teaches, feels and goes through himself, allowing the participants of his workshops to be just that: individuals on purpose with purpose! Highly recommend to be around him for as much as possible if you want to learn how to freely be your true self and shine your gifts onto others!",5,2020-07-14
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"Become friend with the cold and reconnect with your breathe. Amazing activities at beautiful locations. Alex is super professional and knows what he is doing. If you wanna take your wellness to the next level and change your mental, physical, emotional and energetical conditions, that’s the place to go. Highly recommended!Since the work with Alex was so inspiring I decided to join his teacher training last month. We learned so much shared and exchanged with fellow breathworkers.I have now more tools at hand and gained in confidence when doing my workshops with people. Perfect for everyone who wants to go deeper into their practice and/or facilitate for others.",5,2020-07-13

ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This is not a retreat, it's a proceed. Alex facilitates the transformational process of finding the very best of yourself, stepping into the uncomfortable and thriving. I arrived on the first day feeling unsure about life and my path. After just three days of Breathing Cold, I truly felt a deep shift in myself, one of clarity and success.This is the best use of time and money I have ever used. Alex holds the space so well and provides a great amount of knowledge alongside his energy and wit. If you join a Breathing Cold workshop you will make friends for life and every single day will be the best day of your life. Thanks Alex!",5,2020-03-19
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I attended the 1 day Breathing Cold workshop and it was absolutely amazing! I have been living in Bali for 2 years now an it was definitely one of the best experiences I have had on the island. Alex is an incredible teacher and really holds space for everyone, paying close attention to the specific needs of the participants and creating a safe space for connection and transformation. This workshop was about so much more than ice baths! I feel I got a much deeper understanding of my own psychology around fear and discomfort and began to shift some big energy in my life. The workshop was a few days ago and I'm still feeling the profound effects of this experience.  I highly , highly, recommend!",5,2020-02-09
ubud,Breathing_Cold,This day was mind blowing not only for me but everyone who came to this special workshop!Alex has so much knowledge! The morning is about breathing and ice bath. During the ice bath Alex has been very supportive I was scared and he even stayed in a bath with me holding my hands all a long. Thank you so much for that coz i am not sure I would have gone without your help!And I decided to stay for the afternoon part which was wonderful no words can describe.I will definitely try again the experience.See you soon!Alexandra,5,2020-02-04
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"Do yourself a favour and attend one of Alex's workshops.  You will learn the power of cold therapy and breathing techniques to enhance your life and help you to be  mentally stronger.  I was nervous and anxious at first but it didn't take long for me to feel completely comfortable within the tranquil surroundings, and in the company of Alex and the other great people in my group. Lunch is delicious and healthy and the visit to the waterfall is a something truly special. This workshop is better than excellent.  If you are open minded and want to improve your life, it will be a day of discovery for you.  Alex is a great guy too.  Very friendly, caring, knowledgeable and respects everybody's individual needs. Thanks so much Alex!  I hope to come back for the 3 day retreat some time in the near future.",5,2020-01-24
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I am a week back from the 3 day workshop.  OMG! It was easy, kind, loving, and a challenge.  Its effects ,love and support is still with me.  I am on fire and in love with my life again. Not words ....I am in my life now and living it and I am excited about my life so its easy to invest in myself now.  So if you find yourself thinking about doing this go have your own experience see what happens.  push yourself do it.",5,2020-01-22
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"The way this was recommended to me by a friend was ""just do it, it's hard to explain, trust me, you'll love it!"" And I did! Alex just knows how to guide and encourage and help you feel powerful whilst taking you to so many different places so that each day is a wonderful and very meaningful adventure. Just so it. You'll love it :-)",5,2020-01-14
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"What a fantastic, inspiring experience this day was, and (as Dutch person;) might I add: great value for money! You will be invited to challenge your self physically, mentally and emotionally, combined with light hearted fun, great food, beautiful locations and a lot of memorable photo opportunities. Alex does an amazing job of guiding everyone threw the experiences in a caring, safe and fun way! It really gave me a well needed boost in letting go of experiences and habits that don't serve me anymore and welcome in new healthier happy ones. Definitely recommend this day for anybody who wants to learn valuable lessons in handling stress/well-being and explore their connection with themselves and others!",5,2020-01-11
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I would definatley reccommend doing this workshop early on your Ubud stay. The workshop encompasses so much more than just breathing and ice baths! Without giving too much away, great food and interesting places are all part of the experience, and the extra activities are things you would want to or should do anyway. So get them all with Alex!",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This workshop was incredible. I’ve never done breath work and am beyond blessed this was my first experience. I found Alex was crazy insightful about the science behind the breathwork and then I felt at ease being guided in the work with him and the crew. I’ve been a TM meditator for 3 years and have done yoga for 6 but, believe that this breath work is the quickest way to process and release the trauma stored in the body. 3 weeks later I still have done this simple but helpful breath work every day. The ice cold plunge was an incredible high, it woke up my body, helped me deal with some of the fear. I was impressed everyone in the group stuck in it. Lastly, we were taken to this beautiful sanctuary in the rainforest. I don’t want to give too much away about it for others who go on this trip but the waterfalls and the cave was so beautiful and spiritually healing for me.  I really felt opened up, alive, warm And am beyond grateful for this journey. Ps- I never post reviews online. That is how much this experience has moved me and how much I want to give back in any way I can to it. Best,Blaine",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This was amazing. I didn’t know what to expect prior to attending, so I was very nervous at the start. Alex was very understanding, managed to make me feel very comfortable and allowed me to go at my own pace. When I faced the challenges such as holding breath and getting into the ice bath Alex was very supportive and made me feel at ease. We finished the day by going to a secret secret temple in the mountains which was a life changing experience! So much nature beauty it’s almost overwhelming. Thank you Alex for a wonderful day. I have learnt a lot about myself and look forward to implementing new techniques I have learnt. One more thing that I feel I should share, is my breathing exercise experience. Having a broken nose I have accepted that my breathing will never be great. During the exercise, I managed to hold my breath for 4 mins!!! I surprised myself! The body sensation I felt during was pure relaxation and absolute bliss. It made me realise how great breathing can feel. Definitely something I will be doing daily.",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"This experience was life changing in so many ways, and I am so grateful for Alex’s constant support and guidance, the level of enlightenment was beyond what I was expecting. Definitely one of the best days I’ve spent in Bali 🙏🏻",5,2020-01-07
ubud,Breathing_Cold,"It was an amazing one day with Alex, A life changing experience. He taught us so many breathing techniques and then guided us into the biggest challenge of our lives which was being immersed in an ice bath. He was supportive compassionate and a true leader guiding us through out the whole experience. I loved every moment of it. We ended the day by going to a secret location filled with beautiful temples and amazing waterfalls. It was out of this world. Thank you Alex. The girls and I loved it. See you again !!",5,2020-01-07

ubud,Breathing_Cold,"I am posting this review to inform other people who maybe thinking about going to this retreat. Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it. You can see all the things we've mentioned in his instagram page as proof of our experience . Very very cult like and disturbing .Research and learn for yourselves. Be safe",1,2020-01-06
ubud,Wayan_Gama_Painter_Group_and_School,"This is the perfect art gallery where they teach the traditional small detailed drawing, which might take months to finish. They also tour you around the house and tell about traditional balinese houses. The professional paintings were costly (hundreds and thousands), but you can get students' works cheaply. I'm not sure whether the prices are just prices where you should start bargaining or not.",4,2020-01-17
ubud,Har_s_Garden,"My experience at Hars Garden was amazing! On arrival i was greeted by him at the entrance to his Jungle after walking through his organic garden, with his dreadlocks hanging near to the floor and a big healthy organic smile.Instantly i knew that this was the ideal place for me.Slowly walking up the steps into my treehouse accommodation trying to take in all the jungle and nature around me.The treehouse was unreal! So simple so unique! It drops off probably 20m from the balcony into the deep jungle with a river and waterfall at the bottom!Waking up at 6am with a very slight few strips of sunlight shining through the jungle canopy, it was torrential rain and i had never felt ever before the pure deep form of mother nature like that! Laying in bed with the large glass windows in front dropping off into the deep wet jungle!The sounds of running water and birds,frogs,monkeys literally i did not want to leave this moment.3hours later i finally prized myself out of my trance to start the course.Breakfast was a huge tray of fruit all from the garden then a main course of salad and ubi (potato) all obviously grown by hars and picked early morning by Hars while i was daydreaming into the jungle haha.What i learnt from this dude was not just how to grow great organic food but how to live in this world with the ecosystem and not against it, also how to create a ecosystem on my land in Sumbawa that was partly destroyed by corn farming. His information was golden and his mission in life (to save the ecosystem and work with nature) also to educate the word on how to grow organic food and to work with nature not against it.Using his own techniques and also others from hundreds of years ago.Basically he is a all time hero and the course was very beneficial to me and my family to create a new life over in Sumbawa living from the land and working with Nature.The course was supposed to be 2 days but i booked a extra day in because there was so much i wanted to learn!Overall i done 3 days 4 nights there, the three hour course a day was not really enough for me to take everything in, ideally i would like to take a week course 8hours a day haha but obviously Hars has a life too and to steal his time that much just wouldn't be fair.When i left he kindly gave me over 30 different types of herbs and strains that i could bring with me to sumbawa.Now all i need to do is keep them alive and spread hars knowledge to others who are grownig using monoculture techniques destroying the ecosystem.Thanks Hars and good luck with your future project in Sumba!Peace joy and healthy food Sir",5,2020-12-27

ubud,Teba_Sari_Bali_Agrotourism,"Had a free guided tour showing plants and parts of how they produce coffee and chocolate. Also included a generous free tasting of coffee, tea (to much sugar) and chocolate, us paying only for luwak coffee if we wanted some. Speaking of luwaks; they were kept in small cages limiting their natural behaviours. It broke my heart, even though the guide told us they set the luwaks free every now and then (not sure it’s true, and they shouldn’t have to stay in those cages even for a short time). Please set the luwaks free and continue to share the rest of this beautiful place and all that it has to offer.",1,2020-02-29

ubud,Teba_Sari_Bali_Agrotourism,"We visit the place a couple of weeks ago and bought a lot of coffees and teas from their shop, all sugar free, according the labels. But back home, everything taste so sweet, like it's full of sugar,  very disappointed,  if that's th case...it's misleading and cheating",4,2020-01-25
ubud,Teba_Sari_Bali_Agrotourism,Don’t visit this place unless you condone animal cruelty. Owl tied to a tree for tourists to have photos with. The poor owl was clearly being tortured. It was wide awake in the middle of the day. The cats that poop the coffee are confined in tiny wired cages where they are all curled up into balls and looking super depressed. Disgusting. Not an acceptable way to treat animals. We could not wait to get out of there.,1,2020-01-11
ubud,Teba_Sari_Bali_Agrotourism,"Let's talk about the good things first. A tray of 15 different samples of teas and coffees are presented to you (for free). Off the top of my head, there was ginseng tea, lemongrass tea, rosella tea, Balinese coffee, coconut tea, lemon tea, ginger tea, mangosteen tea, luwak coffee, vanilla coffee, ginseng coffee, and a few more. They also bring you through the process of making kopi luwak with an exhibition of sorts. In the end, there's a small hut that's been converted into a gift shop with packets of tea and coffee to bring back to wherever you came from. Now about the negative bits. The poor palm civet (where the name luwak comes from) was tied to a steel cage, given a small and shallow pan of water to drink from, and absolutely no food. That's downright animal cruelty right there. I understand the safety precautions that have been taken but having that poor animal sit there, half-dead it seems, really tarnishes your reputation. Either you make him/her happier (somehow), or don't display it at all. Enough said, I would definitely come back for the unique tasting experience, but definitely against how they treat the animals there.",3,2020-01-06

Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen.

seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"everyne walking arounf had no masks on, I seem to be the only dingdong doing so. There was plenty of trash everywhere and this was not becasue of the tourists either. A dog favorite ! This beach is not ready for the reopening of the area to an International market.",2,2021-04-08
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"It is not as what it used to be, busy and crowded, but so quiet instead. Calm and peaceful sunset but I know many have lost their job. Hope things get better soon",5,2021-03-13
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Always fun when the sun starts to set... seems all of Bali congregates at the beach at the end of the day! Awesome sunsets and dozens of choices for a place to relax for a drink or snack.,5,2021-02-21
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"One of the best beach for the enjoying the sunset. But, black sand. The beach in Legian would more recommended.Looking for food: many restaurants in the neighbourhood.",4,2021-02-16
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Seminyak beach is perfect place for morning walk and watching sunset. Not many cafe was open the time we did visit Bali, but its even better as it was clean and not so touristy.",5,2020-11-16
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Great place to watch sunset, get some cold ones and chill with your partner. It was almost empty due to pandemic time, but as we read usually its very busy, especially for sunset time. Beach is very long, sand is nice and waves were to too big as in Kuta beach. Definitely will recommend to all my friends!",5,2020-11-11
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,We went to Bali for the duration of three weeks. Ubud was amazing bat Seminyak Beach is just very cool. Take your scooter and visit different places along the coatsline. Cool clubs and nice litte foody places... I do love a sundowner on this beach. Yes.Due Covid19 we unfortunately won`t be able to travel for a while. Keep this lovely island in your heart and just have a look at your photos over and over again. See you soon.,5,2020-09-27
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Pristine white sandy beach. Ideal place to relax or swim. Located in the vicinity of a chain of high end hotels. Amazing sunset views,5,2020-09-13
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Beautiful sunset, and perfect time to social distancingWe can swim under the sunset before close your day.",4,2020-09-02
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",5,2020-07-09
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Once you go past Legian beach you are on Seminyak Beach.There are also some high end hotels on the vicinity and I noted that it was less busier here.A nice place to have a stroll, popular with surfers and it was relatively clean.",4,2020-06-30
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Seminyak beach is nice and clean. I found it some parts is is very busy and loud and other parts it is very quiet.I had an ocean view room at the hotel I was staying and the view was very relaxing.,5,2020-05-06
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"We travelled all the way across to Seminyak beach from sanur just for the sunset , it took us 45 mins on a 2 wheeler, we waited for an hour, got some amazing pictures of ourselves and finally witnessed the sunset and that was the only sunset we witnessed on the entire trip. You have a lot of restaurants here, huge number of places , the prices are reasonable due to the stiff competition.",5,2020-05-04
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Seminyak Beach is a Great beach! Especially for Surfers! For the rest of us kind of hard to swim in but Great Waves to Enjoy!!,4,2020-03-30
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Nice sunsets, but when you look a little deeper, the beach is awash with plastic and ruccish that washes in.  There are local dogs patrolling the beach, and while they don't interfere with you, they do leave their calling cards. The locals embrace tourists but the touters are also pests - no such thing as a quiet walk along the beach",2,2020-03-21
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Enjoyed lunch at a couple of the beach Cafes and just relaxed for the afternoon. People watching was interesting and we were all serenaded by a group of guitared up singers. very pleasant afternoon,5,2020-03-17
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,I found the beach not to be very clean lot of people trying to sell you stuff on the beach rather swim in the hotel pool,3,2020-03-17
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Amazing place to watch sunset in Seminyak. There are many bars to have a beer or some coctail. You can just relax and watch the show 🤘🏻,5,2020-03-16
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Beers cheap.  Good cocktails.  Sunset to die for.  Recommend getting there about 4pm and enjoy for a few hours. Some bars have music.  Capil Beach bar.  Great food and drinks. Friendly staff.,5,2020-03-13
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Wonderful view of sunset. Happy sounds of families enjoying the ocean and surrounding ambience including kite flying,  live music,  lounging in provided bean bags or merely wandering along the beach.",5,2020-03-11
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"I must admit that eventho' we came in January, I did not find the amount of rubbish that I've been reading in google. You can see pieces of rubbish material on the sand but since I expected the worst, I was actually quite relieved with what I saw.",2,2020-03-09
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,The beach does not have white sands . Hotels have reserved many places and the public are given areas near to the sea where there are many people selling their wares which can be annoying. Not as good as nusadua.  I did not enjoy the beach,3,2020-03-08
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,We arrived and walked the beach. Warm and clear waters. In addition to seeing the crab fight/mating not sure which. Lol,5,2020-03-08
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Great beach and not too busy when we visited. Waves maybe too much for swimming, but a great experience in the waves.",5,2020-03-06
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Purposely chose Seminyak beach of all places in Bali for my trip as I wanted to learn surfing (first timer) and heard the food/drinks options are great. It was the right decisions. The beach was beautiful, lively but not so crowded. Many drink stalls along the main stretch of the beach (near La Plancha) which also rented out beach chairs for you to sit down and the staff were always ready to tell a tales or two to entertain you. The surfing booths were everywhere but not all of them are reputable so do your research before hand. Swimming is possible but try to void those places with warning flag and those with a lot of surfers.",4,2020-03-06
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"SO beautiful but still so much plastic and garbage in water and on beach...Sunrise and sunset are lovely , mid day is too hot..con=ve rup water temp is over 990 degrees.",4,2020-03-05
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Seminyak beach is a truly beautiful stretch of beach.At sunset, to sit and ""see the day out"", with or without a sundowner in the hand, is really fantastic. The water is nice and the waves even more so.However, the beach is littered with plastic bags and what not, eventhough the local authority has frequent motorised beach cleaning throughout the day. It is such a pity!",3,2020-03-03
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,We stayed at the hotel next to the beach. We enjoyed sunsets and live music. The holiday in Bali was not the cheapest. Taxes an service charges on everything but a lot of plastic on the beach. I was shocked. Someone needs to take responsibility and clean it on regular basis,3,2020-03-01
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"During my Jan 2020 visit to Bal, we stayed in Seminyak and went to Seminyak each couple of times for the sunsets. Sunsets are beautiful, but it gets crowded and might come in the way of you enjoying a good sunset. the beach is not great for swimming as the waves could be be huge. there are good beach side restaurants where you can enjoy the sunset, like La plancha and Champlung.",4,2020-03-01
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"I have just spent 5 days in Seminyak. The food here is amazing and the choice of restaurants is fantastic. There is also great choices for accommodation. We chose a Villa with our own pool. Beautiful with good staff but just a little to far out of the main area for easy access back into the restaurants. Be sure to do research for accommodation location. Unfortunately that's where it stops. After a while I got tired of people trying to rip me off. If I choose to barter for an item and I pay too much then that's my bad luck but when I change money I expect to get what is advertised out the front of the shop. I always count my money 2 or 3 times before I leave. In one day out of 4 money changers 3 tried to rip me off. That's just down right stealing. When you catch them out they are more than happy to give back your Aussie money and you move on. It frustrates me when cars have taxi signs on them and when you get in there is no meter. If that's the case I am more than happy to offer the same rate I pay when I catch a cab but they try to charge 2 to 3 times. I go on holidays for food, culture and local attractions, not spend my whole time trying not to be ripped off.In contrast I spent 6 days at the The Lovina Villas in Lovina. This is paradise. The people are beautiful, the resort is amazing and there is plenty of local attractions in the area. Bali is a great place for a holiday and I will always return but unfortunately will limit my time in the Seminyak area to just a couple of days to enjoy the great food before I head out to other beautiful parts of the island.",2,2020-02-29
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"We stayed at the W Bali and had easy access to the beach. We absolutely loved this beach, lots of lovely beach bars with very comfortable loungers, amazing sunsets and a fabulous party vibe at night.",4,2020-02-29
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"This beach is beautiful but does get a lot of locals trying to sell you things. I did get an amazing hand henna tattoo down here but other items were not cheap or quality. Good surf, a lot of learners out surfing and good bars along the beach to have a drink.",4,2020-02-28
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Very nice place to sit back and have a bear and watch the Sunset. Less locals trying to sell you things also.Well worth a stop off for a swim, surf or Beer",5,2020-02-28
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"This is a nice beach up the coast from the more touristy Legian and Kuta beaches. Unlike Legian and Kuta, there were no people on the beach selling beers or sodas, only a few other tourists to share the beach with. My only complaint is that the water is polluted. The water is a little worse in Legian and Kuta, even though people were surfing in the water. The water is definitely polluted as you pass a dead fish on the beach about every 100 feet. I wanted to surf, but when I saw a dead lion fish on the beach, I worried about being poisoned if I hit a dead one while swimming.",3,2020-02-27
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,A lovely spot to eat dinner and watch the sun go down.  The seafood meal was lovely however the experience was spoiled by all the rubbish on the beach.,3,2020-02-25
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,Overall was an ok beach but really some what hard to enter or leave depending on what you want to do. Plenty of fancy hotels located near it. Surf didn't look too bad and is much cleaner than beaches closer to kuta. Won't go back in a rush but is a decent day out.,3,2020-02-25
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"This beach is so much nicer than the others, cleaner and has a much classier vibe.  Whenever I’ve visited the red flag has been up and certainly no good for families wanting a swim.  Adults certainly could go for a Wade in but watch that swell.  Sunsets are a must and draw a huge crowd",5,2020-02-23
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"The beach has great waves, good for surfing. The water was a bit brown but didn't make you dirty.  There are beach chairs and umbrellas to hire for about $5. It was very convenient that cold drinks are sold there as well.",5,2020-02-22
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Giant waves today, water was clean and warm, we lay on Sunday beds sipping on cold bintang. Nice and relaxed. Not annoyed by the beach sellers",5,2020-02-21
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"I have been living in Seminyak village for 10 years in 1976, Although I love walking on the beach I heard many time people drawned here because the undercurrent is very strong. It is a black sand beach and when clear it is great for sunset photoes",3,2020-02-20
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"Dissapointment after Nusa Dua quiet beaches. This beach was a party beach, noicy, grouded and parties all night long.",2,2020-02-19
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,The beach was beautiful but due to tourist a bit dirty. But nothing to take away from it. Beautiful feel with nice shacks with live singers,4,2020-02-15
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,This beach was quite a walk from our hotel but we still made the effort to get there. It is generally clean (although this isn’t the case when the sea has been rough) and it’s long with great sand.You can rent sun loungers for your visit and there are several bars and restaurants to keep yourself fed and watered.The sea can get rough and lends itself quite well to surfing and other watersports. There are plenty of people around here who will teach you how to do it for a price.If you need to get there and back cheaply we used the Grab camp app which was really reliable and very cheap.,4,2020-02-14
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,This is about the best atmosphere at any beach. Loved the set up with 100s of umbrellas and tables and large bean bags/cushions for sitting. Drinks and light meals served on the shore. Excellent music,5,2020-02-13
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,"If it is full for the sunset every evening, there are some good reasons: it is a wonderful beach, a legendary beach. And very clean for years. Perfect for families (kids can walk in the ocean in safety and enjoy the end of waves) or for adults who can enjoy bigger waves further. Many surf-schools all along for beginners, masseuses too, and a dozen of beach-bars/restaurants competing to attract the customers with decent prices for the food, drinks and services. It's summertime 365 days per year. The Beach Boys are locals, always happy (we wonder why? living on this beach!)",5,2020-02-12
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,It was said to be wet season in February but when I was there in early February there was barely any rain. Very lucky to see the gorgeous sunsets for a couple of times.,5,2020-02-11
seminyak,Seminyak_Beach,I was very disappointed by the state of the beach  tried to go to beach bar on beach we were not allowed to enter as we had bottled water and crisps in our bag,1,2020-02-10

seminyak,Eat_Street,Lots of choices to eat but can get very busy later in the night we when around 7pm and it was hard to get a seat a some of the more popular restuarants,5,2020-04-25
seminyak,Eat_Street,Eat Street in Seminyak has a vast array of restaurants. From Greek to Italian but my preference is all ways local Indonesian food. Not cheap but it is the trendy area. Plenty of bars also.It’s location is next to Seminyak Square. Worth a visit. I prefer to eat in the quieter areas,4,2020-03-06
seminyak,Eat_Street,"You can find the best restaurants,bars,cafes and boutiques on this street,that is why it’s always very busy.Prepare yourself for the very slow traffic,especially around the Favela area.",5,2020-02-21
seminyak,Eat_Street,"Without doubt, this is the main focal point and is right in the middle of town. We found ourselves there on many occasions and used it a lot.There are many fashionable shops which aren’t really to our taste but will be popular with some. We used it mainly for its many convenience stores, bars and restaurants.Of the latter there are lots and across many different types of cuisine. Most are pretty good but don’t be afraid to wander up the other gangs and find local places as well.The traffic is incessant so do be careful as you cross the road. Motorbikes seem to choose whether they want to go the wrong way or onpavements frequently so look both ways!",4,2020-02-14
seminyak,Eat_Street,"I stayed near here and it was really close to walk here (and safe). Lots of boutique shops, restaurants and cafes. And a couple of markets at the corners.",5,2020-02-11

seminyak,Eat_Street,The area is a great place to either go and eat or just simply walk up and down taking in the various smells and sites. If you cant find something you want here then you wont find it.,4,2020-01-07
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"Very bad place.. i carried  my dog in , and the security treated me like a thief keep following me to go out even after i said i will go out.. he kept on following..",1,2021-12-27
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,A small shopping mall. I didn’t expect inside of the mall is so smal i just seem H&M in the second floor and didn’t see something good to bought. But it’s okay because in front of the mall i found best place for brunch! It’s made  my day better,4,2021-11-30
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"This place is a tourist trap. I took the Kura Kura bus here. I was expecting a large shopping center with many stores. I was a little let down. There is only a handful of stores here on 2 levels. I walked around here in 5 minutes. The best thing was how modern it was and the air conditioner was top noch. What I did like was the rooftop,  had decent views of Seminyak. Iv'e never been to a shopping center that had this.",3,2020-03-14
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"Stupidly overpriced.  We were quoted almost 4 time’s the price for a pair of shoes.  ATM here is ok, air con is welcome relief, all shops even H&M are top tourist $$$$$",2,2020-02-23
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,Few shops with good selection especially the H&M store. We live the candy store on the main entrance.,4,2020-02-16
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"If you like shopping back at home this could be a good option for an hour or so for you. It is easily accessible at the end of the main street and has lots of parking on site.Along with many of the well-known international and Australian brands there are some other more interesting shops as well.In truth, we don’t like shopping that much so I was was a quick visit. If nothing else, and it cooled us down from the searing heat outside!",2,2020-02-14
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"Poor management for shopping mall. Refused entry over a cup of coffee, which is unusual for any mall. I can understand not bringing outside food or drink into a restaurant. But for a mall? The shops are not even any good, things are more expensive. Only good for aircon and the loo. Wont revisit again.",2,2020-02-03
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"Semiyak Village and Seniyak Square are close to each other. After the heat at the Flea market  we were delighted to find this small mall (with good air con).  A good number of international brands / better quality items, of course price is also a lot expensive.",4,2020-01-30
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,"A smallish shopping mall, with a reasonable variety of shops.  During January, there are still small stalls in the foyer, selling local crafts.  More are upstairs.  The shops are similar to those in any other mall.  A huge sweet shop, selling Hershey amongs other goodies, is on the left as you enter.  There is security at the Mall entrance, so expect your bags to be ""wanded"".",3,2020-01-26
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,Everywhere needs a shopping mall and this 2 story mall is Bali's answer. THe mall is air conditioned and used to have a cafe on the corner where you could grab a bite and a drink however it has recently closed and awaiting a new shop. There is not a lot of variation and the prices are dearer than in the streets but it is still a nice place to stroll and cool down.,4,2020-01-09
seminyak,Seminyak_Village,The village is a group of shops & restaurants where you can find many food options with nice views & many shopping options,4,2020-01-03
seminyak,Nacivet_Art_Gallery,We bought a couple of photos of locals. They will blow up any size photos to a larger painting size and also put it in a travelling tube. Prices can vary but overall not to bad. Plenty of photos to view.,4,2020-01-07
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,This is square is walking distance from the resort. There are few shops inside the mall and it is very clean. There are plenty of restaurants are bars are near the square. It is very lively during the evening and nights. If you are driving around you can get stuck in traffic for long time.,5,2020-05-12
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,Shops outside designer wear all expensive. Had markets opposite but starting prices stupid!! Understand barter system but standing in the heat just too much. Did buy sunnies but only because we knew bottom price from other stalls. She quickly matched what we wanted to pay. Bought fresh wraps $4.40 AUD rolls from The Bakery BUT watch plus plus price not advertised.,3,2020-03-13
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,First time I’ve stayed in the vicinity of Seminyak square and would highly recommend positioning yourself here. Close to shopping and great restaurants,4,2020-03-03
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,"Seminyak Square is a shopping place which is handy if you are staying in the area.A lot of the shops are aimed at tourists, handy for buying sovenirs.Also there are several places to eat.",3,2020-02-29
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,I loved this mall type shopping square. A wide variety of things to buy ranging from from souvenirs to food.,5,2020-02-12
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,"This busy place is definitely the focal point of the town and there is always something happening. It gets really busy in the evening but seems to be pretty much a 24-hour the day place.It offers high class shops, fleamarket type stalls and plenty of parking.There are also a couple of pretty decent bars and restaurants around and, of course, a big shopping mall.",4,2020-02-12
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,"Seminyak Square has a market in the centre of the square, which is ok. The shopping centre had a nice selection of shops, thank goodness for the air conditioning, it was so humid outside. There was a gelati stall and I will say, the gelato was absolutely amazing, so fresh and tasty. This is quite a busy area and there is lots of shops and bars in surrounding streets. Don't forget to get a picture with the I❤️Bali sign.",4,2020-01-29
seminyak,Seminyak_Square,"It is a very tidy and clean shopping mall, you should come here walk around. There have many restaurants, bars and local brand clothing stores surrounding it. It is a good place to kill some time!",4,2020-01-14
seminyak,Reservoart,"This bright, airy shop was very close to our accommodation so we used to looking as we passed.In truth, the art in there isn’t really a to our that but I should imagine it’s popular. If you have the right kind of house this is your place as some of the pieces are big, bright and bold.There is parking outside as well which is handy as it allows you to spend some relaxed time there making the right decision.",3,2020-02-14
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,Many stalls selling more or less very similar things like clothings and accessories. Quite warm under the little canopy setup. Not worth going out of your way for. Ubud Art Market is more interesting.,2,2020-02-14
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,This isn’t too far out of the centre of town so I suppose it is worth a quick visit. You may be lucky and find something that you are after but generally it is the same stuff that you can buy just about anywhere on the island.You will need to bring your bargaining skills as the first price should be nowhere near the last one. There are lots of little bars and restaurants within easy reach of the market itself so you can cool down afterwards with something to eat and drink.,3,2020-02-14
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,"If you are in the neighbourhood, maybe because you have eaten in a nearby restaurant, you are at the end of your holiday, and you need to assemble some gifts or souvenirs to take home, then this place is as good, if not better than most small tourist markets. What it has in its favour is that all of the usual trinkets and gadgets are in one place. The vendors are friendly and are not going to hard sell you, which is always a relief. Things are displayed so you can see clearly what is on sale. The precinct is small enough for you to do several rounds while you make up your mind. And, you can park. So it is easy to access. And, I know I can get in there and out again without it being a major expedition. I quite like this little market for all of those reasons.",3,2020-02-09
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,"Visited this markets as it showed up on our map and wasn’t far from the beach hotel we were staying at. It was really hot and muggy in there due to the limited airflow with the tent style set up. There was nothing here you wouldn’t find on the street and the prices were higher. Rows of basically the same stuff. An example of product price, Nike rubber slides for $35aud. You’d get the same in Sydney for the same price with a warranty and knowledge they weren’t fake.  Also ridiculous in not wanting to bargain down the prices. Another example was a cane bag for 300,000 IDR, when a shop nearby with set price tags had the same for 125,000. My advice is stick to the shops along the street, the airflow is better, people friendlier and you’ll find the same products anyway.",2,2020-02-01
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,It is good with a lot of local crafts clothes and other lot of negotiation and bargain to reach the appropriate price Buyers are nice and polite1-2 hours are enough,4,2020-01-23
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,"If you have a fair idea of what you are looking for and an expected price you are willing to pay, you will love the place. Good range of items - clothes, souvenirs, accessories. The general expectation seems to be a 1/3 of the price quoted. You may be a tad disappointed if the 300k ask and a 100k retort is met with yes please take it. Maybe I should have replied with a lower price. But anyways that is the whole point of a market where you bargain. It is technically not a flea market in terms of throwaway prices. It is an organized retail with multiple shop fronts displaying their wares.",4,2020-01-11
seminyak,The_Flea_Market_Seminyak,"Not the best of Flea Markets. Not a lot to chose from but you may stumble upon that something special. You need to bargain hard with them otherwise you will pay over the odds. Bought a watch that was returned within hours for not working at all, second time the same, third time a charm. It can be hot while strolling around. Worth a quick visit. The good news is that it is near KuDeTa.",3,2020-01-09
