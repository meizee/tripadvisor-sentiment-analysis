Double_Six_Beach,Wrote a previous review up our stay in Seminyak and visiting the beaches here in Bali.Found Double 6 beach filled with plastics from high to low water. Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen. Once you look beyond the rubbish I wonder how much none seen pollutants are in there!!!?.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 5, 2020",1,2020-01-05

Seminyak_Beach,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"July 9, 2020",5,2020-07-09

Seminyak_Beach,"Nice sunsets, but when you look a little deeper, the beach is awash with plastic and ruccish that washes in.

Seminyak_Beach,"Purposely chose Seminyak beach of all places in Bali for my trip as I wanted to learn surfing (first timer) and heard the food/drinks options are great. It was the right decisions. The beach was beautiful, lively but not so crowded. Many drink stalls along the main stretch of the beach (near La Plancha) which also rented out beach chairs for you to sit down and the staff were always ready to tell a tales or two to entertain you. The surfing booths were everywhere but not all of them are reputable so do your research before hand.

Seminyak_Beach,"I have just spent 5 days in Seminyak. The food here is amazing and the choice of restaurants is fantastic. There is also great choices for accommodation. We chose a Villa with our own pool. Beautiful with good staff but just a little to far out of the main area for easy access back into the restaurants. Be sure to do research for accommodation location. Unfortunately that's where it stops. After a while I got tired of people trying to rip me off. If I choose to barter for an item and I pay too much then that's my bad luck but when I change money I expect to get what is advertised out the front of the shop. I always count my money 2 or 3 times before I leave. In one day out of 4 money changers 3 tried to rip me off. That's just down right stealing. When you catch them out they are more than happy to give back your Aussie money and you move on. It frustrates me when cars have taxi signs on them and when you get in there is no meter. If that's the case I am more than happy to offer the same rate I pay when I catch a cab but they try to charge 2 to 3 times. I go on holidays for food, culture and local attractions, not spend my whole time trying not to be ripped off.In contrast I spent 6 days at the The Lovina Villas in Lovina. This is paradise. The people are beautiful, the resort is amazing and there is plenty of local attractions in the area. Bali is a great place for a holiday and I will always return but unfortunately will limit my time in the Seminyak area to just a couple of days to enjoy the great food before I head out to other beautiful parts of the island.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 29, 2020",2,2020-02-29

Seminyak_Beach,"This is a nice beach up the coast from the more touristy Legian and Kuta beaches. Unlike Legian and Kuta, there were no people on the beach selling beers or sodas, only a few other tourists to share the beach with. My only complaint is that the water is polluted. The water is a little worse in Legian and Kuta, even though people were surfing in the water. The water is definitely polluted as you pass a dead fish on the beach about every 100 feet. I wanted to surf, but when I saw a dead lion fish on the beach, I worried about being poisoned if I hit a dead one while swimming.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 27, 2020",3,2020-02-27

It is generally clean (although this isn’t the case when the sea has been rough) and it’s long with great sand.You can rent sun loungers for your visit and there are several bars and restaurants to keep yourself fed and watered.The sea can get rough and lends itself quite well to surfing and other watersports. There are plenty of people around here who will teach you how to do it for a price.If you need to get there and back cheaply we used the Grab camp app which was really reliable and very cheap.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 14, 2020",4,2020-02-14

Many surf-schools all along for beginners, masseuses too, and a dozen of beach-bars/restaurants competing to attract the customers with decent prices for the food, drinks and services.

What it has in its favour is that all of the usual trinkets and gadgets are in one place. The vendors are friendly and are not going to hard sell you, which is always a relief. Things are displayed so you can see clearly what is on sale. The precinct is small enough for you to do several rounds while you make up your mind. And, you can park. So it is easy to access.

It was really hot and muggy in there due to the limited airflow with the tent style set up. There was nothing here you wouldn’t find on the street and the prices were higher. Rows of basically the same stuff. An example of product price, Nike rubber slides for $35aud. You’d get the same in Sydney for the same price with a warranty and knowledge they weren’t fake.  Also ridiculous in not wanting to bargain down the prices. Another example was a cane bag for 300,000 IDR, when a shop nearby with set price tags had the same for 125,000. My advice is stick to the shops along the street, the airflow is better, people friendlier and you’ll find the same products anyway.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 1, 2020",2,2020-02-01

You may be a tad disappointed if the 300k ask and a 100k retort is met with yes please take it. Maybe I should have replied with a lower price.
