Canggu_Beach,"Canggu Beach was wonderful and exactly what I wanted for my vacation. I spent three weeks at an Air Bnb that was in walking distance. My criteria: good surfing waves and yoga. The waves: LOVED them. They came in reliably in perfect sets. Wave after wave after wave, and it's a beach break so you don't have to worry about getting killed on the reef. They are long, firm waves, perfect for long boarding. There are enough waves for everyone, and the locals are very nice, friendly, and laid-back. You can rent boards on the beach, or bring your own. The Yoga: There are several yoga studios close by, but I preferred to do my own ashtanga practice before or after surfing, at my air bnb or on the beach.The Beach: Beautiful with deep blue water and a lovely sky. There are stray dogs which will break your heart, but they are not dangerous.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"June 25, 2020",5,2020-06-25

Joga_Yoga_Training,"Hey there,My name is Anja,  I am 35 years old and from Switzerland. Just to mention in the beginning, I have studied before BA and MA and I am used to stressful and challenging situations. But I really have the urge to speak up about this experience.I was sooo... excited and serious about the  200 h YTT and was very disappointed,  unhappy and kind of burned out in the end. Also because there was a very bad vibe and not at all a yoga family feeling. There even was mobbing and people told the owner, there where days when they simply wanted to quit and not showing up no more):Negative Points:- not as expected - not worth the money!- You dont get the 200 h you actually pay for! It was a stress and rushing through the whole experience (exhausting schedule),  superficial know how transfer (boot camp style) and no time to soak in the knowledge. Even if you took all of the free time.- There was a very monotone feeling after the first week. Every morning the same mantra singing and the same meditation.- The book was written in weird kind of english. And we didnt cross all of the subjects at all. This kind of freaked me out, because I really wanted to get this knowledge by professional teachers.- one girl who complained about some points,  got mobbed out by the owner. He wrote her tons of texts, even late at night and it felt like brainwashing her. He told her she would get back some of the money. Which in the end wasnt the case. He first didnt responded anymore, as she really decided to drop out... I mean, for real? Now they have a case with lawyers.- All in one very unserious (everyone got the diploma. Even if they didnt showed up for  the 90% attendance. On the practical  exam day we had the opportunity to put some notes UNDER out yoga mat and look some time, if it should be necessary. One girl had this paper in front of her all the time as she had to teach her first yoga lesson. That was really unprofessional. Also the owner told us many, many answers shortly before the exam. I mean why learning then for 3 weeks?!? Super annoying!--> For example one girl, dropped out of class so many times, she never attended and didnt took the YTT seriously.  Even she missed so many classes during the training  and wasnt prepared at the practical exam day she still passed. That is exactly the kind of Yoga Teacher you dont want or want to be compared like ! This stuff took a lot of my motivation away. As I felt in the end you simply pay for the certificate and that the owner doesnt value the effort you put in at all. - I already mentioned the fact of superficial know how transfer. For example the pranayama (breathing techniques) where looked at for some minutes, after students complained about the lack of knowledge in this topic. Same as meditation and mantra.- Honestly everyone was kind of burned out at some point. We discussed it while having breakfast, but people didnt have the courage to speak up. As they wanted the certificate.- I was personally  looking for the Asana Lab and to learn how to correct the postures. I really dont feel prepared at all in these subjects.- Another thing was the philosophy part, I was so curious about this topic, also because it was teached by a monk. But in the end, a monk is not a teacher. He was talking and talking and no one was listening, or even afraid of asking further questions because  we simply couldnt follow. It would have been nice if a ""normal"" person would teach this topic and then when you understand what its all about, have the chance to discuss with a monk.  Also we had to sit on the floor on basically all the theory lessons, it was just uncomfortable and no one was looking forward to philosophy class no more. The monk himself didnt realize all of this at all. Even after I told him. Let's face it, he is just in another world!- The fact of offering different teachers sound great in the beginning but for me personally the second yoga teacher really just did some kind of fitness class and didnt realize that it simply wasnt our level at all... It felt like a lack of empathy and I was thinking, exactly this kind of teaching is the one I would never ever go for. Surely this is a personal thing of taste.Recommendations:- stick to what you sell- give students the time to soak in knowledge. As I mentioned in my opinion there was a hole week missing. If they could correct this, I guess I would have had a complete different experience.- Be there - be real, be kind and be honest!In the end I got intrigued by a very good marketing on IG. I am very sorry to say but I would not recommend this training at all, as I had not a good experience at all. True Story!I hope you take my review serious and improve some of the points.I wish you just the best,Anja",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"May 5, 2021",1,2021-05-05
Joga_Yoga_Training,Last month i did a  100 hour YTT  course here.  For the money I paid for ( which is A LOT) I was expecting much more. First of all I feel confused as I paid for 100hour course and I had only +/- 70hours of classes which was later explained that the rest is the time we should spend learning at home in the evening. Everyday we've  had 10 hours of training starting at 7 am so i have no idea when were we supposed to learn at home (?) as the course itself was really exhausting. Another thing - we did not have teachers that were supposed to be at the course but some other ones instead. I feel like half of the time spent on the course was just a waste of time because it was really often when we sat and read theory from the book. I was expecting much more of physical exercises. There are two aspects that I really enjoyed : morning vinyasa classes and anatomy classes ! They were lovely and this is what made my course :) Apart of these I feel like the course wasn't professional and definitely not worth the money. I would not reccommend this place,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 16, 2021",2,2021-03-16

I received minimal email communication leading into the training even though I registered early enough for the ""early bird discount."" They don't tell you this, but you can opt out of the housing option and rent an AirB&B for a much better rate and accommodation value. Overall, the program was well worth it.

Imagine, I had no idea what balance was. Struggling but not for long. On first day, the instructors brought me a bicycle to start with. To have the understanding of balance. After 20 minutes we tried the scooter right away. It took 6 times lessons in total. The last 2 lessons we did it on the road.The instructors gave not only good instructions about how to ride, but also safety on the road and most importantly gave you confidence too.

I wasn't expecting to be able to be able to empty my mind at all the first time. Eventually everything went blank unless I touched a wall by accident then my mind wondered again for like 10 minutes before going blank. I fell asleep the last bit of it which I heard was good.

Solace_Float,I had the most amazing experience. Relaxing is really hard for me. I have PTSD and anxiety so when I learned of the benefits I was excited to try! The first 30 minutes my mind wondered to the most randomest things. Which I heard was normal the first couple of times. I wasn't expecting to be able to be able to empty my mind at all the first time. Eventually everything went blank unless I touched a wall by accident then my mind wondered again for like 10 minutes before going blank. I fell asleep the last bit of it which I heard was good. That night I had some of the recognizably best sleep of my life. I'll definitely be adding this to my routine self-care routine.

Tonic_Day_Spa_and_Botanicals,This spa is incredible! My girlfriend and I have tried several different spots in Canggu and Tonic is easily our favorite! It's very clean and the staff is so welcoming. They are so dedicated to giving you a relaxing and memorable experience. Our favorite massage is the Botanical Herb Massage. If you're in the area you need to try it! You won't regret it.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 29, 2020",4,2020-01-29
