Jimbaran_Bay,Needle seen on beach when my partner and I were walking on the beach barefooted. It wasn‚Äôt capped. It was an open needle amongst a load of trash on the beach. Filthy. And there were a lot of kids and beach joggers. Do not recommend.  Beach is also infested with swarms of blood-sucking sandflies and mosquitoes. Avoid at all costs. Seafood by the beach was also not great.However the pool at THE INTERCONTINENTAL is temp controlled and fantastic. It has sunset views. Also the Italian restaurant there was so good that we went again. I usually go for local food on vacation but this was exceptional.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 24, 2020",1,2020-03-24

Jimbaran_Bay,"Beach is bang on average for a touristy beach in Bali. Littered with rubbish and many beach front restaurants severing pitiful food. Amid the hustlers trying to sell you the same shell bracelets, and the midgets nipping at the soft flesh around your ankles, (bugs not people). The beach is just there, there was one redeeming quality that my eyes stumbled upon. An awesome giant pig (Sau) floating out in the ocean. I watched from the water as the pig rode the waves into shore far better than I could hope to do on a surfboard. Eventually the bloated behemoth rolled up the beach due to a push from a strong wave, we looked on in awe as dogs began to appear from nowhere and sniff the carcass out. At that point we decided to flee the terror inducing smell that began wafting from the sorry animal, our escape was swift. We washed our bodies in the chlorinated pool. And that was that.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 19, 2020",2,2020-02-19

Jimbaran_Bay,"A nice place for a fresh seafood dinner on the beach, but please watch out for the horrible taxi mafia thugs who control this area and ruined our otherwise wonderful last night in Bali.If you are anywhere within a 5 minute walk (approx) of the bay and try and order a taxi from any other company (GoJek etc) the Taxi Mafia they will chase you down to harass you and your taxi driver without warning.We ordered a GoJek to avoid the normal scams we have faced many times in tourist areas (fare changes, no change). We were hunted down twice and forced out of our taxis both times by groups of angry thugs.The Jimbaran taxi mafia couldn‚Äôt care less about our baby, who after this ordeal was in tears and screaming. Please enjoy some pics of the aggressive and heartless taxi thugs who try and extort tourists in this area.Bali is a wonderful place to visit, but the country seriously needs to solve its ‚Äútaxi wars‚Äù. The otherwise positive experiences of tourists can be quickly ruined by such problems & aggressive behaviour.P.s. It‚Äôs not about the money. We tip our drivers exorbitantly. We are travelling with a young child and we prefer the security of booking online, tracking the drivers arrival, having a fixed price & being able to tip generously on our own accord.P.p.s. Thank you to our GoJek driver who went above and beyond to get us home.

Jimbaran_Bay,"If you plan to visit Bali for a nice beach experience, then just dont. Go to Lombok or elsewhere. We stayed 2 weeks at Jimbaran bay Beach resort and spa, which is an excellent hotel, but the Jimbaran beach is like all beaches we have seen in Bali, dirty and disgusting. Deach fishes, plastic waste and all kinds of dirt is in the water and at the beach. It will ruin your experience. Your money is spend better in Lombok or Gili Islands or elsewhere. Traffic is also really a bummer...will not come again to Bali. People are friendly, but it is simply too dirty and overcrowded.

Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"Jimbaran was a great and super ""cheap"" experience.It only took us 20' by car from Kuta beach to reach Jimbaran fish market. The market itself is a standard indonesian fish market so do not expect any fancy booths but it offers a huge choice of all kinds of fish and sea food. However the coolest thing about Jimbaran fish market is that just close to it you have the possibility to get your stuff cooked or grilled for a very fair price of 20 000 Rp/Kg. Rice will also be served with garlic or spicy sauce Sambal. We had 1Kg of fresh shrimps ready to eat within 10'.

Jimbaran_Fish_Market,Gorgeous beach and views. Not the golden sands of Australia but plenty to see ....like a Shetland pony on the beach!We wanted to join the fun and buy fresh seafood from the market and have it cooked to order (minimal cost to have cooked) but the sight (& smell) of the many many rows of market stalls with seafood sitting in tubs of tepid water led us back along the beachfront to a restaurant where we selected some fresh fish which had been resting on ice.

Jimbaran_Fish_Market,We asked to be dropped off at this end of the beach to have a look at the market & decide if to eat there. 5 mins in the actually market was enough due to the strong smell.

Jimbaran_Fish_Market,"We were recommended this place by two locals and lots of online rave reviews. ZERO idea why anyone would recommend this place. Its a real local fish market and interesting to see, for about 3 mins. After that good luck finding a decent place to eat with raw fish in the heat. Wasn't my cup of tea.Also be weary of the taxi's. we took a metered taxi from Seminyak to here for less than $100k rupiah and after we ate at an overly prices restaurant, we couldn't catch another meter taxi and even the security guard at the restaurant tried to force us nicely to get a taxi for 180k for a shorter ride to Kuta.We haggled them down to 100k for the rideI wouldn't bother wasting time here while i'm in Bali.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 29, 2020",2,2020-01-29

It was super hot as expected and we were excited to get in the water, this is where the disappointment set in...as we walked down to the water the beach was absolutely littered with trash.  We walked by it and got in the water and the plastic and trash in the water was literally everywhere, it was so disgusting that people could do this to such a beautiful beach.

He had send a message to confirm pick up the day before our arrival (and all other occasions) and was waiting for us at the exact meeting point at the airport, something that can be a bit overwhelming with all the drivers awaiting their passengers. If you lost your luggage, go find him first and he can assist and translate, this is much quicker then trying do it yourself. He also can provide the sim cards for you and the price is cheaper then at the airport. We booked 2 tours with him, a tailored private tour including Wild water rafting (a must do!), Lowak Coffee tasting (and Instagram photo swing over the jungle) & the Elephant Cave. The second tour was also private tailored as we first went snorkelling in the Blue Lagoon (so many fish) a local lunch and the transfer to Ubud from Seminyak.

I have never had (or heard of) any bad experiences when using his services. He is willing to bend over backwards for his customers to ensure they have a fun, safe, and unforgettable journey in Bali. He is the sweetest and has lots of enticing facts that you will appreciate. He always comes prepared and if things don't go as planned, he easily adapts to the situation no matter how out of the way he has to go. Always such a pleasure spending the day with him. Highly recommend his services so you can have a wonderful journey in Bali too. I will be seeing you again Wayan :)",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 26, 2020",5,2020-01-26
Bali_Explore_Tour,Wayan is a champion. He communicates well in English and is 100% reliable. Wayan‚Äôs prices for day trips or commuting across Bali are priced below his competitors and his quality of service is fantastic.

Priority_Stand_Up_Paddle_Bali,Kudos for the team especially Chris who taught us patiently for beginner lesson. We had great time and definitely will come back again.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"August 15, 2021",5,2021-08-15
Priority_Stand_Up_Paddle_Bali,My girlfriend and I had a great experience here. They picked us up from our hotel on Sunset road in Seminyak and took us back afterwards. Chris was a patient and thoughtful teacher with a nervous first time paddleboarder. The water was gentle and warm. It was fun to see the big statue in Uluwatu on the other side of the bay and watch airplanes take off from the (sort of nearby?) airport. Then end our visit with a beer on recliners in the sand. All for a reasonable price...,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 5, 2020",5,2020-01-05

Bali_Explore_Tour,"We had an amazing 3 days tour with Bali Explore Tour, Wayan returned our What's up messages quickly, the driver always were always prompt, took us to various tourist sites along our travel routes, and spoke good English, We felt comfortable !!!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"May 26, 2021",5,2021-05-26
Bali_Explore_Tour,"We have used Wayan twice as our driver now - once to pick us up from the airport, and also to drive us to Ubud. Both times he has been great at communicating (always quick replies on WhatsApp!), arrived on time & been really helpful. Also a really nice guy & we will continue to use & recommend him! :)",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"May 25, 2021",5,2021-05-25
Bali_Explore_Tour,"Wayan is incredibly trustworthy, polite and helpful. Excellent communication (through whatsapp, the main way to communicate on Bali). He had send a message to confirm pick up the day before our arrival (and all other occasions) and was waiting for us at the exact meeting point at the airport, something that can be a bit overwhelming with all the drivers awaiting their passengers. If you lost your luggage, go find him first and he can assist and translate, this is much quicker then trying do it yourself. He also can provide the sim cards for you and the price is cheaper then at the airport. We booked 2 tours with him, a tailored private tour including Wild water rafting (a must do!), Lowak Coffee tasting (and Instagram photo swing over the jungle) & the Elephant Cave. The second tour was also private tailored as we first went snorkelling in the Blue Lagoon (so many fish) a local lunch and the transfer to Ubud from Seminyak. He is a save driver, always on time, with a spot clean van and shares lots of information about traditions and culture. I highly recommend Wayan or his company!! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 11, 2020",5,2020-03-11
Bali_Explore_Tour,I went to Ubud with a different driver . I lost contact with the guy and Wayan helped me find my driver with he's own phone without asking me for a penny. He is one honest guy and a very good person which is hard to find this day's . We are friends and never lose contact donde 2016 when we first met.

Bali_Explore_Tour,"We were very happy to have Wayan, we experienced that many taxidrivers try to cheat on the price and the information they give. Wayan instead was honest and compared to the rest also cheap. He also gave us many information about the island.
