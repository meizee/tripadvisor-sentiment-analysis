Nusa_Dua_Beach,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian. The black sand beaches up in Tabanan and Tanah Lot  are only better because there's no-one on them :)",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 15, 2020",5,2020-02-15

Bali_Collection,We’ve been every time on our  half dozen visits to Bali always seem to end up hereIt’s got a great relaxed and secure  feel and there are plenty of shops and restaurants and it looks really good at night there’s really no alternatives to this placeMy only comment would be that the shops are a little expensive but as I said there’s not much competition apart from  haggling out on the street and we are past doing thatAs other reviewers have said you can get a free shuttle to and from and there are a number of resorts that are located within short walking distance i.e. shuttle then walk back and jump in your pool  The only thing I think is missing really are some roadside stall type operations which gave a real Bali experience that you don’t find here nowBack in 2000 this was a very special place with lots of stalls and hair braiding being done outside under the shade of a tree And it was a great experienceAs I said earlier if you’re visiting this area you really need to visit and you won’t be disappointed except perhaps on some of the prices but the convenience and relaxed atmosphere always make it worthwhile for us,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 29, 2020",4,2020-01-29

Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk.

The_Bay_Bali,This place looks nothing like the reviews and photographs as it was probably in its peak in the 2017 period and now appears in declineAlthough being far over rated we found the walk between the two headlands and in front of the fantastic hotels to be enjoyable and the beach appeared very clean and user friendly. Take swim wear and towels etcThere are a number of free shuttles operating from local resorts some businesses to and from  We went from our local villas where we were staying and we are dropped off at the entrance to the beach walk ..fine for wheel chairs etcYou can go left or right and there are small headlands on either side  Which appear to be very interesting space but due to the extreme heat at noon  we only went to the left and in front of some Beautiful hotel resorts Which looked fantastic Can’t remember their names but if you look them up on a map you can’t go wrong with any of them in the atmosphere would be fantastic here to stayThey all had restaurants where you can eat but we decided to try and find one in the public domain our taxi driver had recommended the dirty duck so we sought it out. Apparently it is very popular with Asian visitorsUnfortunately we found it most disappointing _ crispy skin duck was not what I thought it would be and looks more like leftovers from Hiroshima  The duck spring rolls were very Greasey we sat inside next to and are below fans as it was so hard and not in the area which does have a view of the beach unfortunately the indoor area reminds me of a Chinese industrial site similarly for our experience we forgot to take our Mosquito repellent and our legs and feet were attacked which is really not their fault ! just did not add to the experience and the kebab restaurant next door which has a large menu appears a better choice From what we saw this is certainly not a shopping centre in any shape or form but a nice little beach with a handful of restaurants if you wanted a change of scenery from your hotel surrounds yes I’m glad that we visited this Location but I can see no point in returning however the walk between and including the head lands on a cooler evening could be a romantic walk. Worth a visit if you’re bored and don’t want to leave Nusa Dua,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 23, 2020",4,2020-01-23

Nusa_Bali_Spa,"From entrance, you are greeted and offered a welcome drink. The choice of massage oil out of probably more than 10, it shows client orientated to suit one's needs. The lady that took care of my massage( Nur, hope I got it right) was excellent with her technique and very careful when pressure needed changing. Just VERY relaxing and soothing.EXCELLENT.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 26, 2020",5,2020-01-26

Nusa_Bali_Spa,"I’ve been coming to Nusa Bali Spa for two years, on several visits to Bali. The spa is air-conditioned and spotlessly clean. Every time I go, whether solo or with friends, I am greeted warmly. Service is very professional, and the value is good. This time I was alone and, after a grueling series of flights from the U.S. and layovers, I decided on my first full day in Bali to treat myself to a 90-minute massage...without oil, which just makes me hotter in this hot & humid climate. I had an excellent treatment in a relaxed environment, with calming Balinese music in the background. I’ll be back again soon, and when my friends arrive in a couple of weeks, I’ll be bringing them too.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 19, 2020",5,2020-01-19
TSL_The_Shampoo_Lounge_Nusa_Dua,"Wow- what an experience.  This place rocks.  The shop has been open for maybe a year.  Everything is new, very clean, hip and sharply decorated.  Feels like you have stepped into a fancy day spa in the states or any western country.All the staff are super friendly and for the most part speak excellent english.  Their range of services is vast and extensive for both men and women.  They have designed it to have a traditional men's barbershop on one side of the building and a fancier ladies salon on the other side of the building.Check out their website for a glimpse of their offerings.  If you don't see a service you are looking for, simply call or whattsapp them to ask if they can perform whatever you desire and chances are they will be able to arrange it.I go regularly for a mens' clip and cut.  If you connect with a specific barber, find out his work schedule and make a request for him when you book an appointment.  Speaking of appointments, I highly suggest calling ahead to do so, as on the weekends and even weekdays they can sometimes be empty and other days be slammed.The mens haricut rocks.  Starts out with a fantastic head massage/hariwash, followed by the cut of your choosing.  There is a huge board with suggested styles (all with a specific number to order by) you can check out while getting your wash.  Then afterwards order your haircut by number off of the board, or simply tell the barber if something specific and let them do the rest.  After your cut, back to the shampoo station you go to wash out all the short clipped hair and another scalp massage.  Finally back to the chair for any final touch ups, a fantastic neck/shoulder massage and style.  You would easily pay over $50+ UDS in a major city for a haircut experience like this.  At the Shampoo Lounge  it will be just a fraction of that price.  They are constantly offering special deals so call ahead and plan your visit accordingly.The Manager (Christina) is a gem.  She runs the place as if it is her personal mission to make every guest feel right at home.  Tell her Nathan sent you and she will take great care of you!And the best part of your Shampoo Lounge experience is the if you have worked up an appetite during your treatment, there is an amazing Mexican restaurant (Taqisa) just a short five minute walk to the south of the salon.  Best Baja Mexican food on the island.  Think Street tacos, Burritos with tender pulled meats and fresh salsa made daily.  A definite must if you are a foodie and enjoy south of the border authentic Mexican cuisine.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 2, 2021",5,2021-02-02

After the cut it was blow dried and then styled. Hairdresser Agus was fantastic and did a great job. My daughter was with a spa therapist (I cannot recall her name) who took amazing care of her. She was put in a mini sarong, given a hair wash, head massage with the hair mask and then a shoulder and arm massage whilst the mask was sitting. My daughter took the 'princess' part literally as she wanted the 'Elsa' treatment, so the lady then braided her hair at the end like Elsa.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 6, 2020",5,2020-01-06
