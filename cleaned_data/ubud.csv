Passing the serene rice paddies, my daughter spied some local kids clambering up and down the terraced pathways and took off to join them with her little brother scampering behind. A few muddy moments later we were being ushered through a short cut to Monkey Forest by our tiny neighborhood tour guides.Monkey Forest is a nature reserve with sacred Hindu temples and over 600 monkeys.

Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"One of our first stops in Ubud and it didnt disappoint, you just have to watch out for the monkey. As I sat down to rest on a wall, I was approached by a monkey who wanted me to hold it. I quickly realized that they work in pairs. One butters you up while the other eyes you up and down to steal your stuff.  While holding the one, another run up my back from behind, sat on my head for a moment beofre pulling out one of my diamond earrings. They love shiny stuff. After much convincing and realizing he couldnt eat it, he promptly threw it back at me. You wouldnt believe it unless I posted the pics which I have. A while later during our walk around the park, we had one jump on us and try to get into my pack. We had left the zipper open slightly and there was a bottle of sleeping pills inside. Luckily I stopped it, just be smart. Zip up your zippers. Hold on tight to your phone. we saw one lady get hers stolen when she tried to take a selfie with a monkey.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 19, 2020",5,2020-09-19

Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"No stay in Ubud would be complete without a trip to its famous Monkey Forest, the name alone sparks the imagination. Its goal of preserving a forested area peppered with traditional buildings and temples all for the purposes of protecting hundreds of families of monkeys is a noble one, and the reverence with which the monkeys are held in (as well as their near-total control of the area) does go a long ways to show this. However, and this is unfortunate, the way the Monkey Forest has been given over to tourists does bring the quality of the experience down. There are signs and constant reminders not to feed, approach, or otherwise interact with the monkeys, and yet a lot of these go unheeded. Because of the influence of belligerent tourists, the monkeys have become a lot more aggressive and demanding in their search for food and other sundries and it definitely leaves a sad mark on the reputation of the site. We saw monkeys stealing cigarettes from one tourist, which is on one hand a great display of karma, but on the other its most worrisome as you know the monkeys are going to have a bad time finding out that cigarettes aren’t edible. The irony that a spot as famous as the Monkey Forest is both thoroughly funded and fundamentally ruined by tourists never fails to give me existential dread. The scenery and imagery of a wild, winding forest full of Balinese statues and temples, themselves covered in cavorting simians is a wonderful sight to imagine when heading out to the Monkey Forest. The reality of a choked and crowded walkway, blocked with tourists trying to tempt juvenile monkeys with sugary treats will forever hold the Monkey Forest back from its real goals.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 7, 2020",3,2020-09-07

Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,We loved our visit to the monkey forest in Ubud. We drove on our moped and there was plenty of parking available outside the forest. Tickets were cheap and getting there was super simple. Be prepared to get waved down by people trying to get you to visit the nearby coffee plantation on your way. The monkeys are huge and they can get pretty vicious when fighting. Don’t get in their face too much because you are in their territory now. As long as you are respectful when taking pictures then the monkeys are quite calm. Don’t panic if they try to climb up you as there are rangers there to help. Too tip is to have a padlock in your bag because those monkeys are super clever and we saw them open up someone’s zip bag to steal the contents. There is a lovely cafe at the entrance serving delicious fruit juices and it is the perfect place for a good instagram picture . Have fun guys !,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"June 24, 2020",5,2020-06-24

Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"When we visited Bali, one of us was on crutches with a broken ankle. This made ALL tourist attractions very difficult and tiring to navigate. This was one of the most expensive places to get into but that being said - just getting to see these little guys up close made it so worth it!! This isn't one of those attractions that under-delivers -- you get to see these monkeys running, playing, and stealing things from tourists. It is so fun to see them running freely! We would advise listening to all the warnings about not bringing in food. The monkeys WILL find it, even in a zipped back pack! It might be wise to not take a bag in if you can get away with it. If you're traveling with a person that is injured or handicapped, be prepared for a lot of walking. We didn't get to see much of the forest because it was so spread out and tiring, but what we did see was all ramps and walkways with very few steps which would make it fairly wheelchair accessible. There were areas with steps that we skipped since we couldn't go up and down.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"June 14, 2020",4,2020-06-14
Sacred_Monkey_Forest_Sanctuary,"A trip to Bali is not complete without visiting these precious monkeys!  Give yourself a lot of time as the sanctuary gets busy!  Don't wear shiney anything (jewelry) as the monkeys will stop at nothing to grab hold of it and not let go.  DO keep your purses closed as they like to rummage through them.  Only feed them food acquired there at the venue. They LOVE food and will get very aggressive if they see it.  Don't try to tease or taunt them with food. They will come after you. There are zoo keepers inside that will take photos of you with the monkey (near you)...utilize them, and tip them well.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"June 8, 2020",5,2020-06-08

Afterall it has a good up and down with flat route.There are many reason to like this spot for trekking. It gives u a ""jungle vibe"" because u can see plant, grass everywhere even sometimes in your path. However it still gives u the comfort from the paved path given. I survived that path with pencil skirt. Also, the start and finish are 2 different places. I started my walk from a place near Blanco museum. I ended my walk to a village area that has many hotels and restaurant with rice field view.

Campuhan_Ridge_Walk,We did this walk early in the morning! I would say the best time because it’s the coolest and the sun coming over the ridge was spectacular. If you keep walking far enough there are some homes with small businesses. And if you keep walking farther there are some open rice fields that are stunning with the sunlight hitting them. There are a lot of Airbnb here to stay in that look gorgeous. After we complete the walk we went to where it started and turned right and walked all the way into town. This was a very manageable walk which was just very slightly uphill on the sidewalk by the road. There is a beautiful walkthrough where the cars go that have vines hanging down. I would highly recommend this walk as it is so peaceful in the morning.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"April 12, 2020",5,2020-04-12

The area serves as both a tourist hub, a religious site, and a legitimately beautiful scenic spot (which may account for the first two things).  Two things to be aware of before heading to check out one of Ubud’s most iconic waterfalls are these: the stairs and the weather. We took the stairs from the main entrance of the site down to the river that the waterfall flowed into, and whilst the way down wasn’t that bad, the way back up was a workout we were was not ready for at that time in the morning. As for the weather? We went to Tegenungan the morning after the first serious rainfall in Bali for months and the waterfall, as a result, was a violent, brown frothy rage curtain of storm water.

Tegenungan_Waterfall,"One of my best experiences in Bali was this waterfall. One needs to buy a ticket worth 20,000 Indonesian Rupiah and take the steps down to the waterfall. A thunderous waterfall which leaves droplets splattering on your face. It was just amazing! The rocks are a little slippery and one needs to be careful and needs the right footwear. We had a great time taking pictures at various points from the Bird Nest to the waterfall. If you don’t want to go down, then you can also take a picture from the top which offers a beautiful landscape of the waterfall.

Getting into the falls isn’t easy as you have to climb over a lot of rocks. It’s roped off so you don’t go too far as the falls are quite strong.

Tegenungan_Waterfall,"The Tegenungan Waterfall is a very popular spot with locals & tourists as it is fairly close to the city, just 10 km outside Ubud. The waterfall is open from 6:30 am – 6:30 pm. However, the best times to enjoy it would be between 9:00 am – 3:00 pm.Visitors can park their cars at an open parking lot at IDR5,000. There is no charge for motorcyclists. Lockers & toilets are available but chargeable, as well.Walking a few steps ahead after getting our tickets, we were greeted by a very large signage of “Welcome to Tegenungan Waterfall”. Along the way to the waterfall were shops selling food, drinks, swimming paraphernalia & souvenirs. Since we were pressed for time & I had some ankle issues, we walked to a viewing point area or location. From there, we could see a full view of the Tegenungan Waterfall from afar. There were many people at the waterfall. We could also see a wedding photo opportunity taking place! We took quite a few photos of the waterfall in the background surrounded by a lot of greenery & rocks before leaving. It was quite surreal. I could almost feel the cooling water on my skin.The waterfall may be categorised as a small one but its gushing water is undoubtedly very strong. The water that plunges into the pool below is not very clear. However, it does provide a cool respite against the hot weather around the year. Since it is not very high, you can find thrill-seekers jumping off the cliff despite having prohibitive signs around. The water may not be deep enough to cushion the jump downwards.Further reading suggests that one must walk down approximately 150 concrete wide steps with safety rails before reaching the waterfall area. A restaurant with an open-air design has been built near the falls. There is also a large swing for insta-worthy photos which we had missed.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 13, 2020",4,2020-03-13

Women are not allowed in if they are menstruating! This is the 21st Century isn’t it? Anyway once you are in you need to be aware of the dodgy guides that follow you like a bad smell until you don’t even realise they are guiding you! Once they have you they then demand $20 for their services – that’s four times as much as the entrance fee. Unfortunately for the guide who latched onto me I only had $2 in cash on me. To say he wasn’t happy is an understatement and put a whole negative vibe on the experience. I just wanted to get out of the place! It may have been a whole lot better experience without the guides but unfortunately I was only left with a sour taste.

They provided second breakfast at the top with coffee, eggs, toast, fresh fruit (not the normal banana pineapple papaya - but some more unique - mangosteen, and a couple things I can’t remember). Then we stopped at a restaurant for third breakfast - which was a huge buffet. Totally unexpected - or at least I don’t remember being told about it. On the hike, our guide - Kadek - explained local history, different plants, the recent volcanic activity and was generally a thoughtful and helpful guy. Then we went to the hot springs near Mt Batur which were great. Nice and clean. Other ones on the island not so much. As a bonus, on the way home we saw the rice terraces at Teggallalung. They were outstanding. Then as a second bonus, we went to a coffee plantation for the tour and tasting of about 12 different coffee and teas.

I'd advise checking the quality of the clothes before buying, I noticed holes in a few of the dresses I picked up, luckily before I'd bought them.The famous basket bags that you see everywhere, in various patterns and colours, were selling for around 200,000IDR. I was a bit worried about the haggling situation, I wouldn't say its my comfort zone, but I went in there with an idea of what I wanted to pay and walked away if I couldn't get it.

Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"This is a tourist trap. It’s most unlikely it is even a coffee plantation or do any of their own processing or roasting.  There were scattered plants of random native fruit trees and robustas coffee plants but no arabica in sight. 1st red flag.  Everyone is assigned a personal guide to explain about the Luwak cats, their harvesting methods and traditional roasting.  It is very scenic and beautiful with the valley and vegetation surrounding you but don’t let this fool you, calling this a plantation is a real stretch. I didn’t see more than 5 coffee plants and less than 10 cats in total. There’s no way they would be able to produce anything on a commercial level supplying the souvenir store with their product.  This place is more for taking pictures (swing and nest extra$)and Instagramming your experience, and I’m almost 100% sure tour companies and drivers get a kick back from bringing in visitors.  The biggest joke of all was their free samples of coffee.  Everything tasted like heavily sugared watered down instant coffee. Worst than tassimo or any of those junk coffee pods.  If you want good coffee or maybe just decent coffee, there are plenty, PLENTY of wonderful espresso bars all over Ubud that take coffee seriously.  I ended up purchasing the avocado coffee and dark chocolate out of guilt for the free tour and samples they provided us. Upon arriving home, I opened up both products to try. Neither product was edible. The coffee had specks of instant coffee granules in a mountain of powdered creamer and the chocolate tasted nothing like chocolate, more like a bar of palm oil. Also both products did not list their ingredients. Red flag #2.  I would have been so embarrassed had I gifted these as souvenirs.

The hosts were not pleasant either. Luckily, I decided to walk there from Ubud since I had a lot of free time and stumbled on the way back upon a house of a local artist that is located on the road when leaving Ubud - wow - that was amazing in comparison. A genuine Balinese artist's home of I Gusti Putu Sana. Not only I had a chance to walk around his family home, got invited for coffee and could experience the genuine Balinese art.

Puri_Saren_Palace,"As part of our tour through Ubud, we found ourselves deep in the commercial end of town (by the Monkey Forest) which is where the Puri Saren Royal Palace lies. If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that. Not an essential stop by any means, but if you want more of that Balinese architectural goodness then you can easily fit it into your schedule.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 7, 2020",3,2020-09-07

Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives.

The workshop was a few days ago and I'm still feeling the profound effects of this experience.  I highly , highly, recommend!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 9, 2020",5,2020-02-09
Breathing_Cold,This day was mind blowing not only for me but everyone who came to this special workshop!Alex has so much knowledge! The morning is about breathing and ice bath. During the ice bath Alex has been very supportive I was scared and he even stayed in a bath with me holding my hands all a long. Thank you so much for that coz i am not sure I would have gone without your help!And I decided to stay for the afternoon part which was wonderful no words can describe.I will definitely try again the experience.See you soon!Alexandra,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 4, 2020",5,2020-02-04
Breathing_Cold,"Do yourself a favour and attend one of Alex's workshops.  You will learn the power of cold therapy and breathing techniques to enhance your life and help you to be  mentally stronger.  I was nervous and anxious at first but it didn't take long for me to feel completely comfortable within the tranquil surroundings, and in the company of Alex and the other great people in my group. Lunch is delicious and healthy and the visit to the waterfall is a something truly special. This workshop is better than excellent.  If you are open minded and want to improve your life, it will be a day of discovery for you.  Alex is a great guy too.  Very friendly, caring, knowledgeable and respects everybody's individual needs.

Breathing_Cold,"This workshop was incredible. I’ve never done breath work and am beyond blessed this was my first experience. I found Alex was crazy insightful about the science behind the breathwork and then I felt at ease being guided in the work with him and the crew. I’ve been a TM meditator for 3 years and have done yoga for 6 but, believe that this breath work is the quickest way to process and release the trauma stored in the body. 3 weeks later I still have done this simple but helpful breath work every day. The ice cold plunge was an incredible high, it woke up my body, helped me deal with some of the fear. I was impressed everyone in the group stuck in it. Lastly, we were taken to this beautiful sanctuary in the rainforest. I don’t want to give too much away about it for others who go on this trip but the waterfalls and the cave was so beautiful and spiritually healing for me.  I really felt opened up, alive, warm And am beyond grateful for this journey. Ps- I never post reviews online. That is how much this experience has moved me and how much I want to give back in any way I can to it. Best,Blaine",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 7, 2020",5,2020-01-07
Breathing_Cold,"This was amazing. I didn’t know what to expect prior to attending, so I was very nervous at the start. Alex was very understanding, managed to make me feel very comfortable and allowed me to go at my own pace. When I faced the challenges such as holding breath and getting into the ice bath Alex was very supportive and made me feel at ease. We finished the day by going to a secret secret temple in the mountains which was a life changing experience! So much nature beauty it’s almost overwhelming. Thank you Alex for a wonderful day. I have learnt a lot about myself and look forward to implementing new techniques I have learnt. One more thing that I feel I should share, is my breathing exercise experience. Having a broken nose I have accepted that my breathing will never be great. During the exercise, I managed to hold my breath for 4 mins!!! I surprised myself! The body sensation I felt during was pure relaxation and absolute bliss. It made me realise how great breathing can feel. Definitely something I will be doing daily.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 7, 2020",5,2020-01-07

Breathing_Cold,"I am posting this review to inform other people who maybe thinking about going to this retreat. Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it. You can see all the things we've mentioned in his instagram page as proof of our experience . Very very cult like and disturbing .Research and learn for yourselves.

Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"The main reason to visit was the Bali Swings which is part of the coffee plantation.We had the tour of the small plantation, sampled the various teas and drank the Luwak coffee which is reputedly to be very expensive. We just shared one cup. Tasted like Nescafe to me once you put milk and sugar in.There is a popular gift shop where you can buy the various teas and coffees. However Bali has no shortage of these types of shops and I can never vouch for the genuineness of the Luwak coffee beans.Once the tasting was done, we went to the swings.

Other than that this place is a Must to visit.Not just a tea and coffee plantation tourist centre but one with a difference!Allegedly £75 a cup in some London venues you could be quite correct in calling it crxp. It's that coffee made from the coffee beans eaten by a local furry critter, passed, separated, skin removed and then called the rarest coffee in the world.After free tastes of 13 of their coffees, teas and hot chocolates, I had no qualms about spending a couple of pounds on this, £73 well saved.

Besides that, I honestly think all of the coffee is fake. There are very little coffee plantations and the place is very small. Also it was very disappointing to find out that the coffee we bought has nothing to do with the coffee we tried there, and it is VERY expensive! It is just a mixture of very average coffee mixed with a lot of sugar, and the 2 spoons per 150ml is not even closely enough. Oh yea, I should probably mention you can get it for way cheaper anywhere in Ubud.Very bad tourist trap, don’t go there!!!

Maybe it's the overpriced ""Luwak"" coffee that tasted like Nescafe and creamer gone bad (I'm almost sure it did not come from the poor civet cats they had on-site). Maybe the grumpy employee who literally was the only unfriendly local we met in all of Bali. Guaranteed nothing is authentic or as advertised here (including all the fake good reviews here!)

Satria_Coffee_Plantation,"This is a tourist trap. It’s most unlikely it is even a coffee plantation or do any of their own processing or roasting.  There were scattered plants of random native fruit trees and robustas coffee plants but no arabica in sight. 1st red flag.  Everyone is assigned a personal guide to explain about the Luwak cats, their harvesting methods and traditional roasting.  It is very scenic and beautiful with the valley and vegetation surrounding you but don’t let this fool you, calling this a plantation is a real stretch. I didn’t see more than 5 coffee plants and less than 10 cats in total. There’s no way they would be able to produce anything on a commercial level supplying the souvenir store with their product.  This place is more for taking pictures (swing and nest extra$)and Instagramming your experience, and I’m almost 100% sure tour companies and drivers get a kick back from bringing in visitors.  The biggest joke of all was their free samples of coffee.  Everything tasted like heavily sugared watered down instant coffee. Worst than tassimo or any of those junk coffee pods.  If you want good coffee or maybe just decent coffee, there are plenty, PLENTY of wonderful espresso bars all over Ubud that take coffee seriously.  I ended up purchasing the avocado coffee and dark chocolate out of guilt for the free tour and samples they provided us. Upon arriving home, I opened up both products to try. Neither product was edible. The coffee had specks of instant coffee granules in a mountain of powdered creamer and the chocolate tasted nothing like chocolate, more like a bar of palm oil. Also both products did not list their ingredients. Red flag #2.  I would have been so embarrassed had I gifted these as souvenirs.

To my disappointment, the paintings are ""tourist"" oriented, fast made copies, often representing the same themes, colors, etc. To be honest, the same types can be found back home sold to tourist. The hosts were not pleasant either. Luckily, I decided to walk there from Ubud since I had a lot of free time and stumbled on the way back upon a house of a local artist that is located on the road when leaving Ubud - wow - that was amazing in comparison. A genuine Balinese artist's home of I Gusti Putu Sana. Not only I had a chance to walk around his family home, got invited for coffee and could experience the genuine Balinese art.

The funds from your purchase here go to the collective of over 150 artists, we got 2 really special pieces of art instead of one since the variety and selection was so vast, for less than the price of the 1 we found downtown, what's not to love about that?!

Puri_Saren_Palace,"As part of our tour through Ubud, we found ourselves deep in the commercial end of town (by the Monkey Forest) which is where the Puri Saren Royal Palace lies. If you didn’t know this was where the royal family spent some of their time, you wouldn’t be the only one; the palace itself seems fairly innocuous when compared to the likes of the temples and traditional family houses you see casually around Bali. Whilst this may seem to make the royal family that bit more relatable to the average local, in all honesty it was just more of the same that we had come to expect from the temples of Ubud. That was not to say the palace wasn’t an aesthetic marvel, more that the style of Balinese architecture that we had seen throughout our travels in Ubud is itself incredible and this was, at the risk of repeating myself, just more of that. Not an essential stop by any means, but if you want more of that Balinese architectural goodness then you can easily fit it into your schedule.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 7, 2020",3,2020-09-07

Breathing_Cold,"I had the amazing opportunity of experiencing one of Alex's online/offline teacher training courses.What a profound and beautiful experience it was 🙏🏻🙌🏻. Alex has this belief where he only teaches what he has experienced himself, and passes that on to his students, so through out this course you are experiencing everything you need to know, hands on, in order to hold space and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and authentic relating.So as much as I was learning to facilitate these wonderful modalities, I was also learning how to deal with and release all the trauma and baggage I had accumulated since I was a young child. This course equipped me with tools I have been searching for my whole life. So you not only learning o teach , you are experiencing it first hand, going through the motions, releasing, integrating, rewiring your own mind body and soul. So by the time I had finished the course, having experienced my own healing process, I had the confidence, wisdom and knowledge I needed to go out into the world and do what I was called to do in this life, and I'm doing it 🙏🏻☀️. I currently teach and facilitate breathwork, icebathes and many other modalities to people needing to find that inner peace, contentment, joy and bliss we all need in our lives. And we are finding it every day 🙂🦋🙏🏻.Thank you Alex, peace and love to you brother 🙏🏻☀️",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 28, 2021",5,2021-09-28

There were many interesting speakers and facilitators showing their own style and I felt encouraged to also find my own breath and what works for me. If you want to teach or not, the training is a beautiful opportunity to connect with yourself and other people.

Alex is a master of creating experiences that I will remember my whole life. Experiences that taught me so much about myself and reminded me every step of the way that I'm just a human, with all that comes with it. And it's ok! It's all ok. Learning to be comfortable in my own skin, emotions and thoughts and understanding how to communicate with all of that. This approach hugely resonated with me, because this is exactly how I wanted to work with people and just didnt understand how at the moment. Alex brings out confidence through teaching freedom and independence, support and motivation. He is very transparent with what he teaches, feels and goes through himself, allowing the participants of his workshops to be just that: individuals on purpose with purpose!

I found Alex was crazy insightful about the science behind the breathwork and then I felt at ease being guided in the work with him and the crew. I’ve been a TM meditator for 3 years and have done yoga for 6 but, believe that this breath work is the quickest way to process and release the trauma stored in the body. 3 weeks later I still have done this simple but helpful breath work every day. The ice cold plunge was an incredible high, it woke up my body, helped me deal with some of the fear. I was impressed everyone in the group stuck in it. Lastly, we were taken to this beautiful sanctuary in the rainforest. I don’t want to give too much away about it for others who go on this trip but the waterfalls and the cave was so beautiful and spiritually healing for me.  I really felt opened up, alive, warm And am beyond grateful for this journey. Ps- I never post reviews online.

Breathing_Cold,"I am posting this review to inform other people who maybe thinking about going to this retreat. Beware of what you are getting yourself in to.My wife and I booked to go on this retreat believing it was for breathwork and cold exposure, what we got was a big shock.When we got picked up we were told we had to wear blindfolds and was not allowed to speak. This felt very weird and strange. Being blindfolded in a car with complete strangers. We didn't feel safe at all.The whole event was built around Alex's own bizarre ideas, and when we questioned hm about his qualifications, he just said ""life experience”. He talked and talked for hours about himself.At lunch we were told again that we couldn't speak to anyone, so everyone sat there eating terrible food and not being allowed to chat. So very weird. We actually thought it was a joke.Another major concern we had was the way Alex touched female participants. In the ice baths, as well as breathing exercises, Alex touched the Womens chest very often. This was so strange as to why he was doing this.We were forced to look into his eyes when we got in the ice bath which was probably the straw that broke the camels back for myself.To round off the whole bizarre experience at the end we had to all gather in a circle around Alex and touch him. Were he talked about giving him energy. This was the weirdest experience of our lives.We don't recommend anyone go to this event without understanding what you are getting yourself in it. You can see all the things we've mentioned in his instagram page as proof of our experience . Very very cult like and disturbing .Research and learn for yourselves.

Har_s_Garden,"My experience at Hars Garden was amazing! On arrival i was greeted by him at the entrance to his Jungle after walking through his organic garden, with his dreadlocks hanging near to the floor and a big healthy organic smile.Instantly i knew that this was the ideal place for me.Slowly walking up the steps into my treehouse accommodation trying to take in all the jungle and nature around me.The treehouse was unreal! So simple so unique! It drops off probably 20m from the balcony into the deep jungle with a river and waterfall at the bottom!Waking up at 6am with a very slight few strips of sunlight shining through the jungle canopy, it was torrential rain and i had never felt ever before the pure deep form of mother nature like that! Laying in bed with the large glass windows in front dropping off into the deep wet jungle!The sounds of running water and birds,frogs,monkeys literally i did not want to leave this moment.3hours later i finally prized myself out of my trance to start the course.Breakfast was a huge tray of fruit all from the garden then a main course of salad and ubi (potato) all obviously grown by hars and picked early morning by Hars while i was daydreaming into the jungle haha.What i learnt from this dude was not just how to grow great organic food but how to live in this world with the ecosystem and not against it, also how to create a ecosystem on my land in Sumbawa that was partly destroyed by corn farming. His information was golden and his mission in life (to save the ecosystem and work with nature) also to educate the word on how to grow organic food and to work with nature not against it.Using his own techniques and also others from hundreds of years ago.Basically he is a all time hero and the course was very beneficial to me and my family to create a new life over in Sumbawa living from the land and working with Nature.The course was supposed to be 2 days but i booked a extra day in because there was so much i wanted to learn!Overall i done 3 days 4 nights there, the three hour course a day was not really enough for me to take everything in, ideally i would like to take a week course 8hours a day haha but obviously Hars has a life too and to steal his time that much just wouldn't be fair.When i left he kindly gave me over 30 different types of herbs and strains that i could bring with me to sumbawa.Now all i need to do is keep them alive and spread hars knowledge to others who are grownig using monoculture techniques destroying the ecosystem.Thanks Hars and good luck with your future project in Sumba!Peace joy and healthy food Sir",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"December 27, 2020",5,2020-12-27

Off the top of my head, there was ginseng tea, lemongrass tea, rosella tea, Balinese coffee, coconut tea, lemon tea, ginger tea, mangosteen tea, luwak coffee, vanilla coffee, ginseng coffee, and a few more. They also bring you through the process of making kopi luwak with an exhibition of sorts. In the end, there's a small hut that's been converted into a gift shop with packets of tea and coffee to bring back to wherever you came from. Now about the negative bits. The poor palm civet (where the name luwak comes from) was tied to a steel cage, given a small and shallow pan of water to drink from, and absolutely no food. That's downright animal cruelty right there. I understand the safety precautions that have been taken but having that poor animal sit there, half-dead it seems, really tarnishes your reputation. Either you make him/her happier (somehow), or don't display it at all. Enough said, I would definitely come back for the unique tasting experience, but definitely against how they treat the animals there.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 6, 2020",3,2020-01-06
