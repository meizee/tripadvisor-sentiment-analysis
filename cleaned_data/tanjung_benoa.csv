Turtle_Island,"There were many turtles in the collection, some of which were very large. There was a guide there that explained all the animals.In addition to the turtle, there were several species of birds and other animals, such as the luwak in the cage .

Turtle_Island,"Awful. Shockingly bad environment for a range of poor animals.Turtles are kept in shallow concrete pools with literally nothing but a tiny bit of sand in the bottom. Not a stone or piece of seaweed. Water looked quite deoxygenated. These are marine animals that dive deep, they are not meant to be kept in 30cm of warm water with no stimulation at all. A range of birds in empty wire mesh cages. An eagle with nothing in cage except a tree branch, that’s it, nothing else. Bats didn’t even have the luxury of a branch. Fruit bats hanging from the mesh at top of their cage. Apart from one that was jammed into a rabbit hutch.Who locks a peacock in a cage? They hang around if fed and treated well. A row of sad birds in small cages with nothing else in them.I was disgusted and fuming!Bali zoo, bird park and safari are great - great examples of how to house animals in appropriate and stimulating environments. This place should be shut down and the owners locked in small empty cages - see how they like it.Please, please, please for the sake of these and future animals do not go. Do not give them any profit from treating animals this way.Absolutely disgusting.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"June 27, 2021",1,2021-06-27
Turtle_Island,"A visit to Turtle Island was included in a tour we booked. We were told it was a conservation site for turtles however we would disagree. The turtles are kept in exceptionally small 'pools' about the size of a square bath. They then show you the other animals they have caged or chained which include; bats, and owl, an iguana, toucans, and others I cannot recall. No information on HOW they rehabilitate them to be released, and all are available to take photos with which would imply they are being abused for profit.

Turtle_Island,My husband and I visited Turtle Island yesterday and were pleasantly surprised.  We got there by glass bottomed boat through which we saw lots of beautiful fish.  The turtles that had been rescued were in clean water although could have done with being in bigger pools.  We got the impression they were cared for unlike some people who have done reviews.  One person said the python had its mouth taped.  This was not the case yesterday and I cannot think why it would have been as pythons do not bite.,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 26, 2020",3,2020-02-26

Turtle_Island,"This place is not doing any animal  conservation.  The poor turtles are in ankle deep filthy water, not enough room for them to swim. They encourage you to touch them for photos. They look so sad and desperate to be free. Then there are the tiny cages for the other animals - monkeys, birds, lizards and a snake with it's mouth taped shut. I actually walked out before we got to that section in tears after seeing the poor beautiful turtles in their hellish enclosures. This place needs to be shut down. The price is a con too, $100aud for snorkelling in filthy water that I refused to do, and a trip in the glass bottom boat to the island which is not an island at all. It's all a huge scam.

Turtle_Island,"We left Turtle Island extremely upset at the poor living conditions these poor animals are living in. Firstly we were charged $118.00 AUD for a one hour tour run through BMR Dive and Watersports. A total rip-off. The brochure shows that the turtles are in the ocean when you visit them. Complete bulldust, this is far from the truth, these beautiful turtles are living in a dirty pond of minimal water. The other animals, birds, goannas are all living in small cages, the snakes looked seriously sick and the mongoose's living conditions brought tears to my eyes, it was in a tiny rusted cage without even a floor in the cage, this poor animal was also not well. To top it off, the cheek of the guide, he tried to say that he was a volunteer and would like a tip. Please please do not support or go to this horrific tourist attraction. It should be shut down immediately.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 24, 2020",1,2020-02-24
Turtle_Island,"We went on a boat trip to Turtle island under the impression of going to a turtle conservation zoo.At first it seemed exciting to be able to go into the water with these majestic giant turtles, our guide started out with lots of informative information and good fun distracting banter, I struck up a happy positive conversation to delve deeper into what is really going on here,as my thoughts kept thinking of possible buy, keep ,sell,I don’t know however judge for yourself if you go and ask lots of questions.The guide did reveal that the turtles are bought off local fishermen for a sum of money The most disturbing thing is the bird who was terrified of the keeper, very stressed, when approached the bird was squawking, hissing and bristling its neck feathers, the bird would obediently jump on to the visitors arm when the keeper approached, running off terrified after, when I mentioned its stress the guide said “ he likes it “ or they love massage, it was encouraged to hold and pat each animal. There was a very big group of kids and families, kids chasing the birds anything goes here, appalling !!!! , I felt very sad after visiting.Needs urgent action Worst of all the people are so friendly and lovely making a living as best they can, completely unaware of what is ethical or of basic animal care they just can’t comprehend how to care for the animals if only somebody could show the way here.Why are the monkeys there and not at the monkey park orphanage?

Turtle_Island,"We bargaind down to $80 US and what a frigging rip off. Boat was dirty, the operator stopped over some fish and just about gased us all, we told him to keep moving. The water was full of trash on the 10 minute boat ride to the most horrendous cages and dirty pools of water to supposedly see animals in a conservation area on the inlet not an Island.  Then you pay for a someone to take you through the cesspool and to use their gross bathrooms.Don't fool yourself every guide gets a cut of where they take you that charges admission and thats how we ended up there to get a ride on the boat with his friend. Do not let them take you to places to eat that they pick, choose your own and have them stop there.

Turtle_Island,The visit to Turtle island was awful.it is claimed that it is for turtle conservation. It is like a zoo out of the dark ages.animals kept in concrete enclosures with no vegetation. The big poor sea  turtles have not enough water to swim and are crowded into a small space. There are other animals like snakes and they have their mouths taped together so they can't bite. Owls sitting on a perch without a tree.The whole place is horrible and a money making scam .I hope they do have eggs in the sand and release hatchlings but there is a better way without being cruel to the animals.The business should be banned!

Turtle_Island,"I failed to do my ""homework"" before going. We were running out of places to go to, and our guide-cum-driver spontaneously suggested this place, saying the kids would like it. We agreed, without any idea what it was all about.We got to the jetty where we had to haggle with the boat operator to get us to the island. This was when it should have set alarm bells ringing, but I failed to pay heed because they did a good job getting the children excited about seeing animals etc as a distraction. The operator first quoted some price that was plain insane, to probably test our ""appetite"", observing our facial expressions carefully. When he noticed we were not impressed, he quickly add ""but... because we are all Asians, I give you big discount"" and offered a less ridiculous, but still ridiculous, price.I was about to walk away when he offered another ""best price"", and this to-and-fro on the endlessly adjustable ""final best price"" just went on for several rounds before it got to a point when at I was just tired of the process, and when I knew at least I would not be feeling silly and kicking myself, and agreed, just to get on with our day.We had a boat to ourselves (my family and our guide). The boatman must have been the most accomplished sailor ever, being able to steer a boat with his foot and save his hands for cigarettes. He brought us somewhere five minutes out where he handed out some bread to the kids to throw in the water, to attract fish which we could see from the small glass panel at the bottom of the boat.After getting rid of the bread, we continued on the ride to the island, about 10 minutes away. Upon approaching, we saw the signs which informed us we were approaching a ""sanctuary"", and the boatman added that the amount we paid for the boat ride actually included a ""donation"" to the ""sanctuary"" on our behalf. Sounded like we were doing something nice for the animals at this point.We were assigned a ""guide"" at the entrance who would bring us around the place. To his credit, he was friendly and tried his best to keep the children happy. However, his individual efforts could not get us to ignore the signs that ""sanctuary"" was quite likely a misrepresentation.The guide claimed that many of the animals were rescued and brought to the island for conservation. To give them the benefit of the doubt, since there was no way of verifying the animals' histories, it was possible to take their word for it that the animals were indeed rescued from somewhere. However it did feel like they were brought to the ""sanctuary"" for exploitation rather than conservation. There were no rules of engagement for the tourists, and we were even encouraged to pick up the animals (ignoring the animals' and our discomfort) for picture-taking. In some instances, the island guide literally shoved the animals at us, telling us not to be shy, and even suggested silly poses with the creatures for the camera.My children (2 and 5 yo) do like animals in general, and did enjoy themselves on the visit, thinking it was a treat to be allowed to interact with the animals up close, and being to young to be able to fully comprehend the ethical issues. However, the adults did not feel too comfortable on the visit. Guess we learned our lesson, to do some research and read some reviews before visiting the next ""sanctuary"".",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 14, 2020",2,2020-02-14

Turtle_Island,"Despite having read poor reviews we decided to take a boat trip here to decide for ourselves. From the first seconds of arriving you are under no illusion at what a hellhole this is for the animals. Loads of Adult turtles in a concrete pool, families wandering amongst them, touching , and generally filling the pool with bacteria. Even witnessed a young lad laying in the water to the hilarity of the staff. The turtles are treated so poorly its unbelievable. One adult Turtle was in a pool alone in about an inch of water, I asked what the deal was with the animal, the lady said it had been unwell for 3 months and was recovering.  I then asked the man who appeared to be running the show and he told me that it was sleeping. Upon challenging what he said he then barked at his staff member for telling me it was unwell. This particular character walks about the place shouting at visitors to pick up the various animals including a massive lizard,Snakes, various chained birds and even encouraged people to go into a bats cage, which suspiciously hung from one leg,for photos while it supposedly slept. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Please do not go there, it is barbaric.  I do not claim to be the worlds most dedicated animal lover but what I saw has left me with sadness and total disbelief. The squalor,  poor treatment and disregard for the animals here speak for itself. Avoid this place if offered a trip.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 8, 2020",1,2020-02-08

They capture these animals and tell you they rehabilitate them and release them into the wild, and there is 0 proof of it, and they have 50-70 year old turtles swimming into walls trying to get out.

Turtle_Island,"Zero stars if I could. The hotel we were staying at had excursions available and the one we chose, myself reluctantly, was a “turtle sanctuary”. We got to the start point where we boat out of. The sales guy is telling us all the price is 80 a person. We ask why exactly and his English get really bad all of a sudden. I told him the 80 dollar package included snorkeling and we didn’t want to snorkel. We only wanted the $50 package that includes the glass boat in crap water and a trip to “turtle island” which actually isn’t an island by the way. He tried to charge us 70 a person anyway and when he realized we only wanted what the hotel had quoted us in print he gave in. We get there and as soon as we get off we meet our “tour guide”. They immediately ask where you are from so they can gauge their prospects on getting money out of you. My only satisfaction here was that after telling them we were from California I am hopeful they were really let down after not leaving them one cent. I don’t want any tour guide I want to explore myself but there was nothing to explore anyway. Beautiful sea turtles in shallow concrete tanks, then they show us their other animals. A couple of crappy toucans, a snake and finally f’ng turkeys. I flew 20 hours to see turkeys? They ask if we wanted pictures with the animals to which I replied “Not at all”. We didn’t give them a dime. They make us take a picture in front of a turtle statue and try to sell it to you. No thanks. Beverages?? As much as I wanted a beer to take a little sour out of the experience, hell no again. No to any “contribution” or money in any of their pocket. Do not ever go. The biggest waste of an excursion you can ever have trust me.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 19, 2020",1,2020-01-19

Ended up paying 700,000 rupees for 4 of us for speedboat. Massively ripped off. Get there and realise this is turtle island not the conservation centre. ☹️ no baby turtles no opportunity to release into ocean. Just a poorly run zoo with poorly treated animals and reptiles.

Bhava_Spa_Nusa_Dua,"After traveling around Nusa Dua the day before, we were looking for some places to relax and to our surprise, there’s a lovely little spa on the ground floor of our hotel. We decided to give it a try, without much thought, but this turns out to be the highlight of our day. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who is also our therapist later Sari, who is very patient and professional. She’s painstakingly explained all the options we can have for a spa treatment and all kinds of essence oil that came with it that smelt amazing. We decided to take on her offer of the signature spa, the symphony of earth I believe.We were led into a very tastefully decorated room that smells all kinds of herbs, and it has a sort of soothing effect to get us instantly into the mood for the spa. After undressing, we were treated by a gentle food massage with ginger, salt, and lemon, and it felt great. There were lots of different types of herbs laid out on the table, and it will be for the herbal bath later. The ways the herbs were piled up is like the how Balinese piled up the offering and it has a certain ring to it that felt peaceful. The massage was great and the therapist Tari and Sari were very attentive to our needs and the massage was right on point that made us totally relaxed. The pressure was just what we liked because we filled out a survey at the beginning. I have been having some stiff necks recently and it’s just great that the therapist noticed it on the form and gave more attention to that area without me even asking. Just some several minutes into the massage, and we were told to get ready for the singing ball treatment. We had no idea of how singing ball would come into play and thought it is like the sound treatment we had a couple month earlier, but it was different. They placed different size of singing bowl onto our back and gently knock on the bowl to make it “sing”, generating vibration and the almost dreamy rhythm. I never thought singing bowl can be this soothing when I can feel it directly on my body. This is a must try. We finished the wonderful massage with a herbal bath, with different types of oriental herbs, lemon grass, ginger, pandan leaf, and again they got the right temperature for the bath. We felt quite rejuvenated afterwards. We would highly recommend this spa experience and it just made our day so so much better.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"November 29, 2021",5,2021-11-29

The premises are starting to look very tired - it could do with some paint and a bit of remodelling but having said that still enjoyed the treatments.,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 28, 2020",4,2020-02-28

The_Home_SPA,"Definitely worth a visit. We were staying at the Grand Mirage and this place was just minutes away- across the road and a couple of metres down a sign posted alley. I had researched the spa on trip advisor before coming to Bali and I am glad I did as it was what I expected and more. The spa was clean, relaxing and the service was excellent. Both myself and my husband were very happy with the treatments we received in a clean air conditioned couples room and thought it was fantastic value for money. We have both attended spa treatments at luxury 5 star hotels in Bali before where treatments cost many hundreds of Australian dollars each and the treatments and service here was on par. Yes, this spa lacks the fancy extras such as a private infinity pool for spa guests or stunning ocean views but you also don’t pay for that in the price.My husband and I both came here twice. I had an aromatherapy massage and my husband had a Balinese massage on the first visit which were both 90 min long and cost approximately $25 Australian each.On our second visit which was on our last day, my husband had the 2 hour, happy hour massage and a full body scrub which was a total of 2.5 hrs long and cost $35 Australian. I had a 1 hour shellac pedicure, and a 90min body scrub and massage that cost $55 Australian dollars.If we would of had these treatments at our hotel it would have been more than double the price. Alternatively, I did not want to go on the beach or in one of the many cheap spas along the street they often lack air conditioning, their hygiene standards can be questionable and they offer limited privacy.I would definitely recommend this spa. We also did not have any problem walking in to Home Spa and getting a treatment straight away but they do have a Facebook page and you can message them via what’s app which they can send a spa menu through.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 1, 2020",5,2020-02-01

Tea_Tree_Spa,"My husband and l had the most unbelievable massage at the Tea Tree Spa at Holiday Inn Resort Benoa. You pay more than other cheaper places outside the hotel, but the spa is immaculate and you feel so pampered. We had a 1 &1/2 hour massage and you could select the oils used. It was very beautiful and so relaxing that we didn’t want it to end.
