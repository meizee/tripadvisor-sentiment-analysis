KDongDing_Local_Culinary_Journey_Day_Class,"The class is held in a private compound in the hills above Ubud.  It's a lovely setting.  We had a trip to the market where the spices were explained by Nyoman, who was teaching us Balinese cooking.  When we came back, we tasted the coffee ground in his garden, it was lovely and he outlined what we would be cooking.  I was with a friend who has never cooked, but he loved it!  Everyone cooked their own food and ate it so everyone had the full cooking experience.  Thoroughly recommend this class.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 9, 2020",5,2020-03-09
KDongDing_Local_Culinary_Journey_Day_Class,"Hey Nyoman & Wayan, sorry for a week late post. First of all, we would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to your families for hosting us. The entire experience is a blast! This is not just a cooking class but you have shared with us the wonderful cultural experience in a balinese family setting and the day-to-day life at the market.  We felt so at home upon stepping into the home compound. I even felt more like a balinese woman when I changed into the traditional dress, eating the food I had cooked. Cooking instructor, Nyoman is fun,joyful and ecstatic, you don't feel pressured not able to keep up to pace. Simple dishes but yet so flavourful!!!! Hope to see you guys soon,perhaps to teach me other balinese dishes... Babi Guling, Ikan Bakar? U guys rock!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 18, 2020",5,2020-01-18
