Service is wonderful, food is surprisingly nice overall too. The entrance tickets may seem a bit pricey but I’d say it is worth a whole day at the pool, plus they have lots of promotions going on. Hopefully they can survive this pandemic. Will come back soon with my kids!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"December 5, 2021",5,2021-12-05
Waterbom_Bali,"We had a awesome day in Waterbom park. First, they give you a wrist band that you can charge and buy food, drinks, etc. in the park. If your wrist band is still charged when you leave. The rest of the money will be returned to you. It is a large water park with high water slides. One of the best parts is the lazy river that sleeps on the tube and the flow of water moves you in a green direction. There are a number of cafes and fast foods there. We used massage there, they were not professional but it is good for the park. Spend a full day at Waterbom,  it 's a lot of fun.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"September 18, 2021",5,2021-09-18

Waterbom_Bali,"In 2015, my family and I planned to go on vacation and my family decided to go on vacation to Bali. In Bali, there are many tourist attractions that can be visited. On that day, the weather was very hot so instead of buying an ice cream, we decided to went to waterbom bali.Waterbom Bali is located at Jalan Kartika Plaza, Kuta, Bali 80361, Indonesia. This water tourism object is perfect for you to spend your vacation with your family and closest friends. Even though there are so many tourist attractions you can visited, Waterbom Bali is a place that you must visit if you go to Bali.There are lots of facilities that we can enjoy in waterbom bali. There are storage lockers, a gazebo, a place to rent a place and there are many restaurants inside. In addition to the many facilities that we can enjoy, there are also many rides that we can play. Climax is one of the rides that we can play, this ride invites you to play in a small hallway with a height of 16 meters above the ground and is able to push you quickly using the flow of water. And also in Waterbom Bali, There are people who is a guards that will watch over us and reprimand us if we commit violations such as eating food while swimming or drinking while swimming.Also if you went to Waterbom Bali, I suggest you to look at the map and remember the rute because I once had lost and get separeted with my cousins inside of Waterbom Bali.

Waterbom_Bali,"My partner and I had the BEST time at Waterbom yesterday. The entire park is immaculately clean, hygienic and organized to a tee! The food was so great and well priced - I really appreciate how environmentally friendly it was too - the food served on banana leaves (including the little dipping sauces). The smoothie I had was the best I’ve ever had anywhere! The slides were so much fun. And safe!! The staff were all so attentive and friendly and professional. Amazing. The showers and toilets were so clean and nothing like other public pools I’ve been to anywhere in the world. The lazy river was so awesome and relaxing. I don’t have kids but I could see so many great rides and pools for the kids to enjoy! I could not speak more highly of the experience we had. People should not complain about the entrance fee and costs of food and drink etc. (my amazing hot dog chips and onion rings was 85k - it’s cheap!!) We pay a LOT more in Australia for our water theme parks and this one is just as if not more deserving to warrant the entrance fee it charges. It’s a bargain in my opinion!! Especially if you pay online before you go. We are so lucky as tourists to have the Balinese people provide us with places like this one. They truly are beautiful, hospitable people. Thank you very much. Ps - it would be nice if people would refrain from smoking cigarettes whilst there - seeing as there are kids around. They wouldn’t get away with it in Australia so it sucks that they think it’s ok to do it here. There definitely are certain groups of Australians that give us a bad name in Bali.

It was breathtaking, the colours of the ocean were spectacular. In 2020 I decided to come back again, it was already crowded (despite of the reduced numbers of visitors due to Coronavirus) and more tourist facilities are erected.

Also no place to hide under the suns, no coconut trees, if want to hide from the sun have to buy drinks at the food stall. The sand is clean. My children liked to play there at 12-13 at noon.

One man even said to us they were genuine, ask the security guard, we had won prizes. The security guard turned and said to us,'Yea, Congrats.'It was quite incredible.

We always wait for bluebird as we’ve found a lot of the other taxi drivers rude and aggressive.  So never again.

Bali_Sea_Turtle_Society_BSTS,So disappointed but I suppose it can’t be helped...!! I spent quite a while researching the different places to go and see turtles while staying in Bali. After reading reviews on Turtle Island and Turtle Conservation in Seregan we chose to visit BSTS. We were dropped at the entrance to Kuta beach and walked along and couldn’t see anything... we asked a local information desk to help and he told us we’d see a giant turtle. On waking back we saw a giant turtle and building covered in tarpaulin. We looked around for a good 10 minutes to find someone to help us but no one was there at all (even though doors were open) we then asked a gentleman sitting on a chair out the front who’s response was no turtles... we only took that to mean it was closed so we left. I’d looked online and on their FB page and there were updates and images so all looks very professional. On arrival is very dingy and looks a little bit of a mess. They have recently updated their FB to say they do not have any turtles to release for a while... this would have been updated earlier as we traveled to the area to see them. With a place like this communication on online fronts need to be at its best so people are aware of what’s going on and when.

During the rainy season, a lot of debris (wood) and rubbish will wash ashore which can make the experience less fun. Please keep in mind that this is a public beach where locals are trying their best to keep the beach clean without any funding from the government. Please beware of monkeys as this arra is still considered a “wild” habitat so those wooden debris that wash ashore will come in handy to scare them away.

Matahari_Kuta_Square,"I love Mata Hari at Kuta Square. It invites you to enter the shopping mindset of the domestic tourist. Prices are so reasonable, luckily, because there is no bargaining here. All fixed prices. The way you pay for your selections, the way they are wrapped, all of this is different to the western way. No speed shopping here. There is everything you need, all under one roof. The iconic department store. You begin by parking underneath. Then you emerge up the stairs with the modest, but more that adequate supermarket to the left, and souvenirs to the right. If it was local fashion that you have come for, or rather nice locally made footwear, then you go to the first level. You wont believe the prices. You will probably buy heaps of things you will ever wear because the prices are minuscule. Getting things paid for and packaged is another story. No one is in a hurry here and please insert some extra steps into the process. If you keep going up you will find toys, mainly and some sporting goods. The trick to succeeding at this style of shopping is to collect everything you think you want to purchase in one hit and then do the paying and wrapping thing. If you to and fro you will become exhausted and annoyed. Now the thing is to put it all in your car and go next door for a refreshing mango juice and coffee.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 20, 2020",4,2020-02-20

If you are in Kuta, this entire “complex” of shops and services are located in the midst of a gang of surf shops, clothes, some fast food, on a one-way street heading north to Legian.Shops and services that are useful to us;Central Kuta money exchange - just outside the entrance to the main department storeA great food store on the ground floor - has great fruits, and all of your groceries and other needs such as mozzie repellent, shampoo and conditioner, etc etcMobile Sim card - located just outside the food store. No fuss sim cards.A Shine shop with girlie and kids stuff like hair bits and cute bags etc. Good for supply of hair ties etcRight next door to Shine is a DVD shop. Nothing special, its just all together in the same spot as all of the above!Matahari department store is sort of ok. Not good for teens or tweenies, but for really young kids, toddlers etc there is an enormous collection of clothes, shoes etc etc. Good also for emergency toilet access!Fast food joints like Yoshinara, Gloria Jeans, A&W, KFC, pizza, all around here in one easy locationFipper thongsA few surf shops, actually all the brands are represented here in the same surrounds (not necessarily in the Matahari building)Nearby to the main Kuta beach front, and the Kuta Art Markets if bargaining is your thingThen onward to Beach Walk toward Legian, or back south on Jalan Kartika Plaza for the gauntlett of other restaurants, shopping, and massage etc. We do the fixed price shops like Rika, Jenny, Dianne shops (all of these on Kartika Plaza) so that we avoid the bargaining thing.A bit of everything that you might need....",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 19, 2020",3,2020-01-19

Kuta_Art_Markets,"I thought that we had agreed to not visit this market again. My wife had admired a ladies beach type dress and been informed that they could be found in the market. A couple of enquiries, and a young lady from one of the stalls understood what my wife was looking for. She asked us to have a seat and dashed off, soon returning with an armful of dresses. The excitement, so many choices, and eventually four purchased. Next morning another visit, another dress and a handbag; happy seller and happy customer.  All five dresses were good quality and excellent beachwear. Judging by the reaction back home, it looks as if another visit will be scheduled if visiting again.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 25, 2020",4,2020-03-25

Petitenget_Temple,"Please Note:  This review is for The Vihara Dharmayana Temple in Kuta.  It’s submitted here because this temple does not have a Tripadvisor site for reviews.  Bonnie, our driver asked if we wanted to stop at this Chinese Buddhist Temple in Kuta en-route to Anika Tailor. We were excited as we missed visiting a Buddhist temple whilst in Lovina.  Buddhism is similar to Hindu Religion and on many levels it connected well with  aspects of our faith and belief, also an opportunity to extend our knowledge and clear our busy minds. The temple dates back to 1876 and is located on JL Blambangan a busy strip of town. Crossing the road was like a ‘tight rope walk’ as we dodged the traffic.  Kuta is well known for it’s chaotic, full on boisterous party scene and beach sunsets, so we were surprised to have stumbled across a bit of peace and serenity at this Buddhist temple. The courtyard has a warm and peaceful feeling displaying goddess statues, menacing dragons wrapped around elaborate pillars. The entrance is dominated in beautiful red and gold with ornate structures, large red lanterns effortlessly swaying in the afternoon breeze. We took off our shoes and stepped inside, observed locals praying and quietly chanting, captivated by swirls of fragrant incense sticks adding to the spiritual atmosphere. We gently tip toed around listening and admiring the intricate interior, leaving us to question many things in life we take for granted.  A sense of peace and calmness lifted our spirits and we appreciated how religion can change one’s thoughts and thinking even momentarily. We wondered at our leisure and it was nice not to be hurried at any point.  Bonnie gave us adequate opportunity for photos and ask local devotees insightful questions, although I guess this would have been in broken English.  The temple is not huge but well maintained, clean and it’s striking architecture gives it that far eastern-style ambience. We enjoyed our stop here and learned religion plays an imperative part in the lives of Balinese people and culture. We left with strong emotions of calmness and a clear mind reflecting how dipping into a spiritual world for a short space of time can alter your mindfulness, we showed our gratitude by leaving a donation.  Yep! we walked away taking only the good, now we were ready to uncover the other crazy side of Kuta!   Tip:  Check opening times prior to visit, be mindful of your attire i.e. no bare arms, no shorts and be generous in leaving a donation.  Terima makasi.
