Sindhu_Market,"We love to eat at food courts and night markets and this one did not disappoint. Approximately 15 different stalls serving a variety of foods. Started with chicken satay sticks which were very tasty. A little on the small side, but at only $1.50 for 10 sticks how can you go wrong. Usual Nasi Goreng and Mie Goreng for under $3 but our new favourite meal is Tami Goreng which is mixed veges and chicken over fried noodles. We went three out of the 6 nights we were in Sanur and because my husband had left something behind at the hotel we also came back to the area after a day trip to Ubud and went to the market again. Also recommend the banana fritters, especially if they are freshly cooked.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 18, 2020",4,2020-03-18
Sindhu_Market,"This is a small night market where you can buy freshly made and cooked foods such as nasi campur, nasi goreng, delicious home made Indonesian sweet foods, chicken, curry, dumplings and much more.

Sindhu_Market,"A great place to visit to get out of the restaurant-after-restaurant-cycle.No fuss night time food market that has all the usual stalls... satays, soups, nasi goreng, mee goreng etc... great value and is somewhere we always return back to.Tried some mixed satays but have to say the lamb skewers were pretty dodgy. Soups looked amazing but couldn't get a seat throughout the night.Absolute highlight was a chocolate pancake thingy that was less than AU$1",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 17, 2020",4,2020-02-17
Sindhu_Market,"Went to this market based on trip advisor reviews, it was exactly as we expected. Small with roughly about 15 eateries. We chose to try a few different smaller bites. Satay chicken was yummy but a 40 minute wait to order and we  were the 1st in line, all the locals get fed 1st they don’t wait in line and they just keep turning up. There was also very little chicken on each skewer, 10 skewers per serve for $1.50.We also went to the fried food stall with spring rolls fried banana, fried beans donuts etc got 17pieces for $1.70 an absolute bargain and also all delicious, especially the fried coconut donut...omg. I also got the fresh juice of banana and dragon, also absolutely delicious . All up dinner cost for both of us $8.80 which included all the above plus a Bintang.My husband and I both left feeling so full. Simple no fuss and delicious. If we were staying longer we would definitely eat here every night.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 10, 2020",4,2020-02-10
Sindhu_Market,Have walked around the night market looking at the different foods on offer many times when in Sanur over the past few years but have never been game enough to eat there until now.After reading other reviews we decided it was time to give it a go and for $5 my wife and myself each enjoyed a lovely good serving of nasi campur. Will for sure eat there again.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 6, 2020",5,2020-02-06

Sindhu_Market,We go here often and still the best value in Sanur for more authentic food. Don't be afraid to eat at this market. The local cuisine here is awesome and cheap. We often go to Ihu du seafood down the back right hand corner. You pick your fish or seafood and the ladies take it down to the gent who I reckon is the Bali master of open grill. Never have I had a crappy prawn and my better half goes the local snapper every time. The ladies do great veggies and rice and will even go and get you a bintang.

Sanur_Beach,"The sanur beach was very good the first week. The beds wasn't too expensive and it was room to lay straight on the sand if we wanted. A little bit trash here and there. The second week on the other hand was not as nice. The front sunbeds was reserved for guests of some hotels which were annoying since a lot of them stood empty. And it was so much trash coming in from the ocean that it was a little bit disgusting to bathe. The beach had little trashcans so if you wanted to do a good deed and pick up trash, it wasn't too easy to throw it away.

You can dine instil or have simple grilled fish and a corn on the cob from the warring net to the turtle conservation canter. The only bugbear can occasionally be the risk of being run over by a cyclist!  It is very quiet, traffic free,apart from the bikes and it's easy to find a quiet spot under a tree with a book.

Went in to look but not only didn't they have any of the brand advertised but the lethargic young man couldn't see why it was not a good idea to be advertising it as they didn't have it. They do have lovely fish but the veggies all packed in plastic leave to be desired. We couldn't buy batteries for heaven sake either.Went back again today as we were passing and again no sanitiser despite there being a little table  where it should have been and a sign saying to sanitise hands. When we mentioned it we got a shrug and a "" no have, run out.""  Inside the store there was one tiny hand sanitiser on one of the checkouts.

About double the price on the street but she does did not want to go through the hassle of haggling at the time and could take her time having a look. Lots and lots  of ladies clothes in particular upstairs. There is a very good supermarket for any groceries or fruit and veg you might need. There is also a wine store where we were able to grab some $20 - $30 AUD red wines.Be prepared to leave back packs at the storage counter out the front and they give you a number to collect it afterwards. They let us take in our small bum bags but that was it. I would not say it’s a must visit or anything but worth it if you need essentials.

By today's Western standards, this museum makes a very modest attraction. That said, I think it needs to be seen in context.

The art lacks vibrancy and fails to captivate me. The art does not appeal to me, but that’s not to says it’s poor or that it will not appeal to others. The presentation is poor and would benefit from renovation / modernisation. Le Mayeur’s model seems to have been a prisoner to his passions, but there again, who am I to comment.

Le_Mayeur_Museum,This was rated highly in our Lonely Planet guide to Bali. We were disappointed. There was an absence of information on the artworks many of which did not appear to be well preserved and which may soon be lost if not better cared for. There was nobody around to answer questions and possibly the most interesting thing to me was the opportunity to see the inside of a traditional Balinese house. I think there is so much more which could have been done with what was a fascinating subject. One thing which I thought was off was that there was no consideration of the fact a 57 year old man married a 15 year old girl after knowing her for three years. The other thing is that you should take care to ensure you have gone to the toilet before you get there.,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 4, 2020",2,2020-01-04

Can't deny that, but my trip was even slightly faster than it should be. All depends on the weather. 6) They took us in the small boat which took us to the Golden Queen...

There is no forward planning with this service which means you can sit at docks for over 20 minutes. When docked, the boat is switched off which means air con is gone. The boat quickly becomes very hot and stuffy and the fumes from petrol get overwhelming and made me feel nauseous every time. One of the male boat crew took my bag at Gili Air for the trip back to Sanur. I noticed about an hour into the trip that he was at the back of the boat with my bag and was sleeping on it! He slept on it for at least an hour and a half after I noticed. I took my bag to sit with me after the boat docked at one of the stops. This man then came back to my row of seating and sat in the chair one seat down from me (3 seats per row) and blocked me and my bag in the row.

Perhaps at the end of the trip I forgot that I am human.The speed boat (?Sheep Goat) arrived 30 minutes late and sadly everyone including little children had to wait for another hour in the hot burning Sun as they had engine issues which was being fixed. It Appears like staff are overworked as they were the only Balinese people I saw who were literally yelling at their customers.The boat stopped in the middle of the ocean.I normally don't write a review but this time I was compelled so that others can at least choose a another safe boat.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 3, 2020",1,2020-03-03
Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"It gets you from a to b but you'll have to do some fighting. I took this ferry from bali- Gili T and back. The trip over was fine, no drama. The trip back was awful; the ferry was over 2h late but that's fine,it happens with other ferry companies as well. However as it was the last ferry, we ended up getting to Sanur after 7pm. It was dark and raining and everyone just wanted to get home. The staff quickly gathered us for the shuttles and then it all went wrong. They started asking for more money to get a drop off directly to the hotel (they asked me for 200k, otherwise they said they would just drop me off in Central seminyak and that it would take at least 4h). I obviously refused to pay, as I had made sure I paid for a return hotel shuttle when I booked my tickets. They tried to get other people pay 300k extra EACH L, otherwise they would put them on a bus with 25 other people and it would take 6h to get to seminyak.These were all lies. The shuttles don't even take more than 15ppl or so.As expected, no body paid and everyone got dropped off at their hotels and I was in  Seminyak in 2h.I have been in Bali for almost 2 year and NEVER have I been lied to so badly. This company is a disgrace and seeing how they tried to take advantage of their guests was disgusting. Surely the staff just wanted to keep the money for themselves...Never again.

Everything is chaotic and non efficient. Once on the boat the bad experience continues... too crowed, dirty, wet, smelly, bad seats, no air conditioning and windows closed because of the water coming in. Suffocating! Arrival on the beach, your luggage are thrown on the sand and water. To get back from Gili to Bali, same thing! Both trips the boat was 1 to 2 hours late. BAD BAD BAD experience.

Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"Yo, I read a lot of reviews for this company so believe me at the beginning I almost threw away my tickets after I bought them and was trying to buy new ones with different company. LUCKILY all the ships were fully booked so we sticked with Semaya One. I realized that actually all those reviews are wrote by a lot of sensitive people that probabbly came to Indonezia and have no clue that this country works a bit different then Western countries ! The guy in the Harbour told me that going earlier is better because of course the sea is calmer. He was right. But let's get to the whole experience. Of course it was full of people, but there was a lot free seats also. Of course it was a bit hot inside, but not like I read here of course. Ships jumped couple times, but it's the small ship not a cruise on a damn open sea, what do you expect ? We travelled with 5 kids, none of them had an issue.Crew didn't speak that much, but if you read all the instructions in the boat, you will never get scammed. So don't show ticket to anyone in the harbour if you bought also transfer with shuttle, go straight to semaya one office and you are completely safe ! It's annoying to go thtu all of these scammers in the harbour, but once we left them behind we got an transfer with shuttle straight to our Villa in UBUD. No issues.Don't be scared, it's allright.

Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,I think most people know that any of the boat transfers to Gili T are fairly average. And they don't get particularly good reviews. This fast ferry used today. Was unusually bad. It was obviously late. It was packed with people and bags. At gili t  it was just a free-for-all. Once we got the pandang bay after a fairly horrible ride there was still more chaos. No one seems to be in charge. If I could find a better way to go to Gili T I definitely would.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 10, 2020",1,2020-02-10
Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"Boat is super hot and packed, also was 1 hour late to pick us up. The really bad part of the experience was the “shuttle” back to your hotel... packed 13 people in a 7 person van and tried to pack even more people in...driver wanted people to sit on the floor?? And then they don’t drop you off directly at your hotel so we ended up having to walk almost 30 minutes. Would have been way less hassle and more safe to just take a taxi (and probably the same price too). Wish we would’ve read reviews prior to booking with this company.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 9, 2020",1,2020-02-09
Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"AVOID this company if you can! Yes, thsi company is a bit cheaper than others,  BUT trust me, you will be happy to pay more first minutes when they will pickup you from yoru hotel or you load into the boat! It is dangeriously over crowded boat. I'm sure, they sell more tickets than the boat can carry, because some of passangers were standing. Boat crew are terrable, they offered my wife and my 5 years daughter to sit in separate rows of the boat, and when we told them that our child msut sit with mom or dad, they shoted "" that every time is the same"".. our luck some polike and understanding tourists changed their seets and we could sit together. The trip was very uncomfortable. Another story is the shuttle from Ubud to Padang Bai port - worst ride ever. The driver was late 1 hour and obviously in a hurry and drove so dangerously. We used many other boat companies before for travelling to Gilis and i can tell you this one is WORST!

Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"We travelled from Gili T to Canggu. Our ticket cost RP250,000 each with a bit of haggling. The guy said this includes a bus straight to our hotel. On Gili T, getting on the boat was fine and getting our ticket was fine. When we sat down we realised just how small and cramped this boat was, with people’s suitcases lining the sides of the gangway down the boat. There were air-con vents but no air-con. The windows had to be closed because the waves were kicking up water that was being blown in. We were sat about half way down the boat and we could not feel any air flow at all. There was some space at the back of the boat to stand with the staff but not much space for many people. Thankfully we had a small electric fan with us, if we didn’t have it we would have suffered. The whole boat journey took around 2 hours - stopping at Gili Air and Bangsal before heading to Padang Bai. When we finally reached Padang Bai, we were escorted by a guy telling us he was taking us to our shuttle bus (a minivan). The guy says it goes to Canggu town but not our hotel. I try argue with him but he says the guys on Gili T don’t know the rules in Bali (lame excuse). Taxis are all over offering to go direct for an hour journey instead of this shuttle bus which takes 3-4 hours. We decide to stick with the minivan. My friend and I are crammed at the back with the bags - thankfully we’re not big people or we would’ve been squashed. The journey takes around 90 minutes - not 3-4 hours like they kept saying. It stops somewhere random in Canggu. The driver says we can pay an extra RP100,000 to be dropped off at the hotel. I’m pissed off now. Lied to twice and not at our hotel - the driver shrugs. He doesn’t care. My friend has already booked us a Grab car for cheaper and we finally put an end to the worst journey we’ve ever had in Bali.

Semaya_One_Fast_Cruise,"I usually did not write reviews but i can not hold myself in writing the review for Semaya one. I Traveled with Semaya one 3 times as recently as 2nd Jan and 4th Jan 2020. Before booking with them i have read all the reviews and i was prepared for all the consequences. I booked the fast boat to travel between Nusa Penida to Gili Air and Back to Bali. The online price was showing was very high. So as suggested by many fellow traveler, i decided to book the boat by going to Harbor. The price i got was 350.000 IDR (Because first they will transport me to Padang Bai and then to Gili Air) as there is no direct Fast boat from Nusa Penida to Gili Air. The boat was little late while leaving from Nusa Penida. They gave us stickers which we need to stick to luggage and on our T Shirt. They organised our bags well. the journey from NP to PB was not that long. But we had to wait nearly 2 hours as the boat came late from Lombok. When we started boarding they organized the luggage well, Gili T passengers they put luggage separately, Gili A and Lombak they put luggage separately. Pretty good. They had given clear instructions. The journey was smooth and Bumpy but good. Return Journey they clearly mentioned that we have to tell them 1 day before when we to travel. I have seen many people just walk in and asking them to board. They were nice enough to board those people which leads to people standing in the boat lot of luggage. As a traveler we also should know if there are rules we need to follow them. I had informed them one day in advance and my name they put in the Boarding list. Smooth. While boarding there were clear instructions given on Harbor that once we reach Bali we have to go to their office in order to get free shuttle, do not hand over the shuttle pass to anyone on boat. Clear instructions given. I have read about the scam of taxi drivers do on the boat so i was relaxed. In the return journey like i said there were lot of people came at last minute because of which they were standing. I mean there should be some system to be followed by boat company (Thats the reason why i had given 4 stars in stead of 5 :)). Anyways the ride was bumpy because there was lot of rains and sea was a little rough. Sea Sick people were vomiting and the staff was providing them carry bags. We reach pretty much on time. Once we reach PB there were lot of drivers,touts came on boat and asking for taxi service many people give away their free shuttle pass to them (Which later had to pay a lot of money to travel to Bali Main land and these are the same people who will tell that they got scammed. If they follow the instructions they will not see the scam)  Long story short. You will get the service depending upon how much you pay. The return ticket from PB to Gili Air is 500.000 IDR. If you compare that with Eka Jaya or Golden Queen its less. Thats why there are no AC a little crowded. But i enjoyed the travel (I may be lucky) and definitely recommended",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 9, 2020",4,2020-01-09

Sri_Rejeki_Express,Sri Rejeki is a well organised company. The process to check in at Sanur was great as was the boat trip. Our price included transfers from our hotel in Legian to Sanur and then from the beach in Lembongan to our hotel. And back again the other way from our hotel to the boat and then a transfer onto our resort in Seminyak. It was very seamless.

El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"I booked a day trip to Nusa Penida with my girlfriend. Taxi transfer collected us at 6:30 am to head to the dock to get the boat to Nusa Penida. Boat was fine have no complaints about that. When we arrived in Nusa Penida we were put into a taxi with another couple. When we booked this tour it was advertised as a private taxi with air-conditioning. I've no problems sharing a taxi if it's advertised as sharing but why say private taxi when it's not. When we got into the taxi we noticed there was no air-conditioning. The other couple in the taxi with us decided to make a complaint to the head office because we were not going to be stuck in a car with no air-conditioning for 8 hours when it is 30 degrees outside and if we weren't getting a car with air-conditioning we wanted a refund. The manager we spoke to informed us that when we reached the next desitination (broken beach) we would get a new taxi with air-conditioning. When we reached the next destination we were informed that the other couple in the car would be moved to another car with air-conditioning but we would be left in the taxi without air-conditioning. Why is it ok to treat people like this? We paid the same amount as the other couple but we were left in the car without air-conditioning. We rang the manager we spoke to earlier and she couldn't see the problem. I've never been so frustrated in my life speaking to someone so incompetent. We refused to continue in the taxi without air-conditioning until they had a resolution to the problem. We explained that we wouldn't off left the harbour if we knew that we wouldn't of been in a car with air-conditioning as advertised in there day trip. We wanted a refund as for the amount we paid we should have been treated better, the manager said that we couldn't get a refund as we already left the harbour. It's a joke, I honestly will never use your company due to your customer service being the worst I have encountered in my life. In the end we just continued in the car without air-conditioning instead of dealing with your manager. At the end of the tour someone from the company approached us to see if we wanted to book another trip and we told him where to go. Don't bother using this company, it's not worth it.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 13, 2020",1,2020-03-13
El_Rey_Junior_Fast_Cruise,"This was a very disappointing experience with many safety and health concerns.We were picked up from our hotel at 6.15 am and taken the Sanur. The drivers did not speak any English and was hard to get any additional information. We were only able to pay in cash which meant we needed to carry in excessive of $1500 to pay for the privilege. We were all loaded into the ferry (not boat) and were required to wait an additional 30 minutes in a very crowded ferry for 2 passengers who were running late!! It was extremely hot in the ferry and many people started to feel unwell. There was no instructions on life jackets or location or any evacuation plan available. On arrival at the island there was very little information on the tour. We were taken to a small room to get our fins fitted. They did not have enough fins to go around and we were told it didn’t matter as “you won’t be snorkelling anyway” we I challenged them that said they can give me a life jacket to swim with instead. The life jackets were in poor condition with broken buckles and tied.During the booking process we were told we would be provided with water, towels, lunch, a guide and insurance. We were provided with 300mls of water each, on request and we asked for more we were told “no more ”!.  Due to no instructions we were required to get changed on the boat. (No one want to see a 50 year old changing into her bathers - I can tell you right now!). The guide told us to stay with him, however did not wait for the weaker swimmers. No towels were provided, until we returned to the island. Be aware There are no toilets stops on the tour boat!Lunch is street food, The menu contained spring rolls -which we felt would be safe to eat, we were told they were sold out. However when paying customers come in they were served spring rolls. On complaining numerous times they served us spring rolls too. All other food was served luke-warm with precooked eggs. The following day 4 people from our party became unwell with vomiting. On returning to Sanur we travelled on a ferry which was in poor condition, with broken seats and  the lock on the front exit was broken so the crew tied the only front exit shut with rope, which would have prevented us leaving the vessel in an emergency. On returning we were transferred back to the hotel as part of the package. Both drivers drove erratically with one driver, on many occasions, driving on the wrong side of the road to pass traffic build up  and drove excessively fast. We are all well travelled, and have been to Bali many time before and undertaken many tours in the past and this would be the most disappointing operator we have experienced. In saying of this I would recommend doing the snorkelling, however not with this company.",1.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 1, 2020",1,2020-03-01

They were very kind and even gave me a piggyback to get to the boat dry as my foot has an injury and should not touch the water.Also they carried all our luggage to and from the boat.The boat was on time and the cruise was very calm even though we heard it is better to go in the morning.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 8, 2020",5,2020-02-08

We paid at Sanur booth and we were told this included transfer to our hotel.  I confirmed this 3 times and all 3 times I was told ""don't worry, someone will be waiting at the dock to give you a ride to your hotel"". The boat was late boarding and leaving. When we arrived at Nusa Penida and transferred to another smaller boat, I asked a few crew members who I was supposed to meet when we got on shore, they blew me off.  When we got to the beach, the boat was immediately flooded with cab drivers and I wanted to make sure we were picked up (as we'd already paid for transfer to hotel), the 3 guys on the boat I tried asking totally blew me off and the one who understood English told me to just get off the boat and there would be someone there.  We got our bags and kept telling drivers we had paid for transit, so didn't need a ride.  We kept asking and everyone said they had no idea, so we went to the Tanis booth.  There were 5 guys there only 1 spoke English and he said ticket only was for boat.  This was what I had anticipated at the harbor and been assured would not happen.  A cab driver tried helping, calling our contact back on Bali, but everyone said oh no it's just the boat tickets, no transfer.  There was another group of 4 people who were in the same situation, they had paid for boat ticket and transportation to hotel and had no transfer on arrival.  All 6 of us ended up just paying to get to our rooms a second time, but not a great first impression at all.All I can say is have low expectations for service and make sure you get a ticket that shows PROOF that transfer is included, don't just trust there will be someone waiting for you.",2.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 13, 2020",2,2020-01-13
