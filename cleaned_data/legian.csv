DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,It’s good for a rainy day or bit of fun for the kids. Looks dodgey from the outside. Prepare to take many photos. Some are quite realistic.

DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"Great for kids and big kids also. They have a lot of rooms with a lot of images that look like flat paintings until you see the photos. You can get some really good effects. The staff are helpful and advise you where/how to stand and where to put your hands for the best photo. You don’t get time to look at your photos and adjust your poses because there are always people coming behind you, so you have to move on. It’s best to get there early before the crowds.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 2, 2020",4,2020-02-02
DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"While the 3D images were great, being followed the whole time by staff definitely made us feel uncomfortable.

DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,"We went here towards the end of our holiday and we were just chilling out, took a taxi from our hotel. The outside does not look impressive, but inside it is good. You have to remove your shoes, if I knew I would have brought socks. It is not dirty, I am just not used to walking barefoot, which you need for this so you do not destroy the art works. They have sample poses and they also have very helpful staff who can show you how to pose and also take the photos for you. I recommend going early to avoid the crowds so you have enough time to get good photos. We were lucky we went there when most people have gone back to work.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 13, 2020",4,2020-01-13

It was only about $22 AUD for both of us. It was nice to escape the weather for the day! Also, on another note, just up is Burger King - hear me out - while I wouldn’t usually go get fast food on a holiday (much prefer to try local food), it is great to see that many of their staff are people who people with hearing impairments and can communicate with sign language.

DMZ_Bali_3D_Art_Museum,We had been to Bali many times but never visited the 3d museum. That was until our last visit. When we walked in we were approached by one off the staff who helped us by placing us in the best positions on the artwork and then taking the photos for us. It wasn't until we actually sat and looked through all the photos we took we realised just how awesome each pic was. Definitely worth a visit whilst in Bali :),4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 2, 2020",4,2020-01-02

Legian_Beach,"The beach and sunset was absolutely amazing. There are a lot of people on the beach selling drinks and with lounge chairs . You will get harassed by some salespeople wanting to sell watches, hats, massages and anything you can think of. Part of the charm of Bali if you don't let it bother you too much. The only negative thing was the beach was FULL of trash. I mean for miles as far as you could see. And not by patrons. You could tell it has all washed up from the ocean. Sad, but really not Bali's fault. It's coming from elsewhere.",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 4, 2020",3,2020-03-04

Legian_Beach,"A pleasantly wide beach, accessed from the iconic gates so beloved by Instagrammers. Watch your step on the narrow and uneven sidewalks to get there. Not only do the tiles rise and fall, you also have to dodge every shop’s floral and incense offering. Upon arrival my husband and I were accosted (yet in a nice way) by a woman determined to give us massages. She would not take a polite “no” for an answer and finally left us after hearing “maybe tomorrow.”A few hours before sunset, the beach shack vendors industriously put out large bean bags to increase their chances for your consumption from them. We were watching the surf school and serendipitously ended up sitting on beanbags at “Jack Sparrow” in front of the Pullman Hotel, with a personable fellow serving up Bintangs. For dinner options there was no shortage of local warungs within a short walking distance. It was such a pleasant experience that we plan to return to this beach at the tail end of our trip.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 10, 2020",5,2020-02-10

Loungers are available to rent for not much money along with umbrellas.It is lined by small shops and some really good cheap restaurants selling local food. Most of the time the sea is quite calm and very safe but it can get choppy. When this happens, lots of debris is washed up which is a real shame and it’s a pity people don’t take more care of it.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 9, 2020",4,2020-02-09

Legian_Beach,"Rico, the owner, is friendly but most of all honest.  He sat and had a chat with us and we all had a few laughs.  We played our music and even had a little picnic and that wasn't a problem. The location was great for us as it wasn't far from our hotel. He even set up a tent set up for a toilet.  I think that was mainly for the guys.  I went to the one at Azul's or there is a public toilet down the way if Azul's doesn't let you use theirs.  When it was time to pay the bill he used his phone and showed us the workings out.I recommend this place to anybody.Thanks Rico",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 11, 2020",4,2020-01-11
Legian_Beach,From someone who swore never to sit on the beach at Bali again .i spent nearly every night of my stay watching the sun go down at Robins bar.Not as many hawkers as used to be and they only have a small patch of ground they must stay in.So is actually very relaxing drinking icy cold buntings in a bean bag where the temp is about 15o cooler than your room across the road.Robins is directly out front of the Legian beach hotel.Lovely guy will tell you if seller not trustworthy and will keep them moving if he senses they annoying you.Thanks Robin.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 10, 2020",5,2020-01-10

Legian_Beach,"Stayed in legian, never tried seminyak or kuta (for comparison)Positives: Beer is about $3 a bottle at most shacks which is perfect for having a few watching the sunset. Some nice bars and restaurants with lovely ambience at the beachside hotels which anyone can use, 2for1 cocktails at $12-$14 (very nice too) and your standard cheap Bintang beer for $3 or $5 for a tall bottle. Meals range from $8 for a beer/pizza or $16 for example duck, steak or lamb. Staff are usually incredibly friendly at hotels and don’t tend to try and rip you off.Negatives: Beaches are lined with rubbish, went surfing, $5 for 2 surfboards although they will try and charge you $10(1 hour) had a few plastic bags wrap around my arms and legs while surfing for 30 minutes. Beds cost around $5 each to hire with an umbrella, or as usual they will try and charge you more. Be prepared to be approached every 3 minutes by people trying to sell you bracelets, sunglasses, hats, watches ect.

My suggestion if you are staying nearby Bounty club : Please don't wear any Gold reckless or Bracelet. These people are good in snatching. Don't carry mobile and purse. Keep only cash which you think is enough for a night. You will not find single Cop over there. My suggestion La favela in Seminyak is a best place for party at night.

Jalan_Legian,"This is the main street that runs through Legian.The street is narrow that is very busy and there are numerous shops, ATMs, money exchange places, restaurants and bars, The Ground Zero Memorial and all of the night clubs located along both sides of the street.Traffic along this straight from mid afternoon right into the knot is extremely slow and hectic with you having to watching every direction if you cross the ride as there are cars trucks motorcycles scooters old traveling often in the wrong direction and so if you don't keep a look at you could easily become a pedestrian victim.A very busy interesting street and there are also a lot of people flying to sell their bits and pieces and scam tourists.A lot of young children walking around asking for money and food and many of them just involved in scams. These young children offer to sell you little trinkets, show you card tricks or ask you to buy them food. If you buy them something like a drink or a small item I will try and get you to purchase them something which is a bit higher in price so as soon as you leave they will take it back to the store get a refund and pocket the money.Some of them a genuine but many are not and some of them are really rude if you don't buy them something they will give you a mouth full of abuse.An interesting street to sit in one of the bars and watch what goes by and what goes on",3.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 30, 2020",3,2020-01-30

The technician was very sweet but certainly did not go above and beyond and the experience was quite mechanical. In Sydney for a similar price, if I had to sit 20 minutes with a mask on , the technician would massage your hand or something. But it was okay.The driver was also Good. The receptionists however were awful. After confirming my daughters could book for massages , upon arrival they said that this was not possible . They could not care less , they also did not try to suggest others treatments and just looked very cranky . They Definitely either need to be sacked or retrained immediately. After I finished my treatment , even though they assured me on the phone I could get a return transfer , they said that it would no longer be possible . Told me they would book a cab and I could get money out of a money changer . I had no cash and was dressed for massage facial so I toldThem i was not comfortable in a cab dressed in swimwear They  laughed when I said I was unhappy   said I could get money from the hotel .

La_Karma_Spa,"We have been going to Bali for many years and this spa is always outstanding. It is clean and has a nice feel. When you have a massage upstairs is really peaceful. And I've never had a bad massage here. However, my friend and I and her young daughter had a massage at a time when they were relatively busy so we were downstairs near the nail bar. It was not all that relaxing we could hear people coming and going from the front door throughout the whole hour and also the staff that did not have customers sat just outside our curtain for the duration and spoke well above their ""Library Voices"" for the whole hour.

The technician was very sweet but certainly did not go above and beyond and the experience was quite mechanical. In Sydney for a similar price, if I had to sit 20 minutes with a mask on , the technician would massage your hand or something. But it was okay.The driver was also Good. The receptionists however were awful. After confirming my daughters could book for massages , upon arrival they said that this was not possible . They could not care less , they also did not try to suggest others treatments and just looked very cranky . They Definitely either need to be sacked or retrained immediately. After I finished my treatment , even though they assured me on the phone I could get a return transfer , they said that it would no longer be possible . Told me they would book a cab and I could get money out of a money changer . I had no cash and was dressed for massage facial so I toldThem i was not comfortable in a cab dressed in swimwear They  laughed when I said I was unhappy   said I could get money from the hotel .

I always feel safe coming here due to the meticulous sterilisation that they have in place for their equipment.The staff also remember you from prior visits which is nice.Best spa in Legian!",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"February 17, 2020",5,2020-02-17
Purrfect_Spa,"Only thing for sure, this is my all time top favourite massage place in overseas. Yes, my top overseas massage ever! It is also a well hidden jem as it is located at an inner street corner. The place is clean. The male massage therapists were skilled, with pressure points on the spot! My main concern left was why they do not want to offer a 2 hour massage? They stated their max is 1.5 hours. Well, still the best!",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 27, 2020",4,2020-01-27
Purrfect_Spa,"I can't rave enough about this place.Massage was amazing.The therapist I had was very thorough and knew exactly what she was doing. A credit to the owners.The rooms are spotless and very calming.The prices are crazy for what you get.The best part of the massage was for no extra cost the therapist will wash you down getting rid of any excess oils so you don't feel all greasy when you head off.Can definitely recommend this place, I promise you won't be disappointed.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 20, 2020",5,2020-01-20

La_Karma_Spa,"We have been going to Bali for many years and this spa is always outstanding. It is clean and has a nice feel. When you have a massage upstairs is really peaceful. And I've never had a bad massage here. However, my friend and I and her young daughter had a massage at a time when they were relatively busy so we were downstairs near the nail bar. It was not all that relaxing we could hear people coming and going from the front door throughout the whole hour and also the staff that did not have customers sat just outside our curtain for the duration and spoke well above their ""Library Voices"" for the whole hour. That was a bit disappointing. Price is great though at 95,000 R.",4.0 of 5 bubbles,"March 16, 2020",4,2020-03-16

La_Karma_Spa,We walked past this spa in Legian and thought it look good so we went on for a foot pamper and it was great. All three of us loved it and we left will soft and massage feet after a long day of walking. We then immediately booked in for the hot stone massage and the coconut oil massage. Both of these were amazing and I would highly recommend. Great pricing and so cheap for a 60 minute massage.,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 2, 2020",5,2020-01-02

Oasis_Spa_at_Lemongrass,On arriving at this spa the lady in reception was nice.That’s were it ended. I have been to many spas in Bali over the 20 plus years we have been coming here. The sheet was dirty apparently from cleaners. You shouldn’t of put this on the massage table then. The massage was terrible hands down just a rub of oil in body. They didn’t have any idea what to do one minute working on your head then down to your feet. We mentioned this to the owner and she couldn’t care less. I don’t like making bad reviews but this needs to be said. Maybe it was a off day but I have had a better massage on beach for a quarter of  the price. I’m not sure of other reviews here saying 5 stars but taking your money for a oil rub wasn’t on. Sorry Oasis but not up to scratch. We weren’t after a free massage if this what you were looking for but you should show more compassion if you will get more clients to come here. We won’t return and will not give recommendations to anyone else. We aren’t Aussie bogans either.,1.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 27, 2020",1,2020-01-27

Ella_n_Dut_Bar,"What a great little find.  Nothing fancy but cheap cold beer, great view and the owners are so hospitable and helpful and what an ingenius toilet.  Spend around 4 hours here drinking Bintang and Cruises and the total bill was around $25 plus Dut gave us each a stubby holder.  Would definitely recommend.   Nice quiet background as no vehicles.",5.0 of 5 bubbles,"January 3, 2020",5,2020-01-03
